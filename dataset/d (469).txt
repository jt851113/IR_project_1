DEFINITION 2.4. Given a pattern 	 with period  and a
sequence  of 

 
  events:       , the
support of 	 within  is the number of subsequences
	 	     	 that match 	.
Intuitively, the event sequence can be viewed as a list of
segments, each of which consists of  contiguous events. There
would be 
 full segments, among which the segment that
	 matches will count for the support of 	. The “*” symbol is a
wild card which matches any symbol.
Consider two subsequences        
and           for the pattern 	 
 . The support of 	 in  is the same as that in ,
which is 3. However, the generalized information gain of 	
with respect to  should be higher than that of  because
there is no noise in  but some noise in . Therefore,
 should “pay some penalty” for its noise, i.e., taking away
some generalized information gain from . The amount of
generalized information gain taken away depends on how 
can be repaired to perfection. In this case, if we replace an event
 with , then  would be perfect for 	. Thus, we decide to
take away the information of  (i.e., the information loss of 	
for the mismatched period in ) from .
