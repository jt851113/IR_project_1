Let us first investigate experimentally the effects of innetwork
aggregation. We run a simple aggregate query
that computes the average sensor value over all sensor
nodes every 10 seconds for 10 continuous rounds. Sensors
are randomly distributed in a query region with
different size. The gateway node, which is located in
the left-upper corner of the query region, is the leader
of the aggregate query. Each experiment is the average
of ten runs with randomly generated maps.
We first investigate the effect of in-network aggregation
on the average dissipated energy per node assuming
a fixed density of sensor nodes throughout the
network (in this experiment we set the average sensor
node density to 8 sensors in a region of 100m√ó100m).
Figure 5 shows the effect of increasing the number
of sensors on the average energy usage of each sensor.
In the best case, every sensor only needs to send one
merged data packet to the next hop in each round,
no matter how many sensors are in the network. The
packet merge curve increases slightly as intermediate
packets get larger as the number of nodes grows. Without
in-network aggregation, a node n has to send a
data packet for each node whose route goes through
n, so energy consumption increases very fast.
We also investigated the effect of in-network aggregation
on the delay of receiving the answer at the gateway
node as shown in Figure 6. When the network size
is very small, in-network aggregation introduces little
extra delay due to synchronization, however as the network
size increases, direct delivery induces much larger
delay due to frequent conflicts of packets at the MAC
layer.
