Assume that a sequence of n
timestamped datasets have
been collected in a database. For each time instant
, let D
 be a set of features derived from the dataset collected at the
instant. Thus, the time series of features is repesented as,
Let L be the underlying set of features. We will also use 
the "don't care" character*, which can match any single set
of features. We define a pattern as a non-
empty sequence over. We will use |s| 
to denote the length of s, and will say that |s| is the period
of the pattem s. Let the L-length of  be the 
number of which contains letters from L. A pattern with
L-lenght i is also called an i-pattern. Morevoer, a subpat-
tern of a patterm is a pattem
such that s and s' have the same length and  for
every position i where . For example, the pattern 
and it is of L-length 4(i.e, it is a 
4-pattern); and a*{a,c}**and**cde are tow of the 
subpatterns of a*{a,c}de.
  The frequency_count and confidence of a pattern s in a 
time series are defined as
where m is the maximum number of periods of length |s|
contained in the time series(i.e., m is the positive integer
such that m|s| ? n <(m+1)|s|). Each segment of the
form where 0?i<m, is called a 
period segment. We say a pattern  is true in
the period segment or the period segment matches,if, for
each position ,either is or all the letters in occur
in the set of features in the segment. Thus, if is a 
subpattern of s, then the set of sequences that can match
is a subset of sequences that can match s'.
Example 2.1 For example is a pattern of period 3; its
frequency count in the featrue series is 2;
and its confidence is , where 3 is the maximum number
of periods of length 3. The frequency count of in
is also.

Similar to mining association rules [2], we say that a pattern
is a frequent partial periodic pattern in a time series
if its confidence is larger than or equal to a threshold,
aCk HZS. The mining of frequent partial periodic patterns
in a time series is to discover, possibly with some restrictions,
all the frequent patterns of the series for one period or
a range of specified periods. More specifically, the input to
mining includes:

?A time series .
?A specified period; or a range of periods specified by two
integers
?
.
?An integer
a
indicating that the ratio of the lengths of and the patterns must be at least 
a
. This will ensure that
the patterns mined would be of value to the application at
hand.
Remark: Sometimes the derivation of the feature series
from the original data series is quite involved, and the interaction
of the periodic patterns with the derivation of features
may lead to improved performance. Hence it is worthwhile
to combine the mining of the features from the datasets with
the mining of the patterns, as is the case for the mining of
cyclic association rules [12]. For our work on the mining of
frequent partial periodic patterns though, this interaction is
not useful for achieving computational advantage and thus
we will assume that we are dealing with the feature time
series in our study.
