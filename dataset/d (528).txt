fine-grained statistics (e.g., inverted indexes) at least about
some of the terms, and in between, statistics about groupsâ€”
each consisting of several documents.
In this paper, we propose a novel solution for efficiently
handling conjunctive multi-term queries, by keeping perterm
statistics as score distributions using two-dimensional
histograms. One dimension of the histogram reflects a clustering
of the documents (of the given peer), and the other dimension
describes the score distribution (of the given term)
in each cluster.
Our contribution is twofold. First, we give an algorithm
that achieves a significantly higher recall at a cost that has
the same order of magnitude as the one incurred by the
state-of-the-art methods. The second contribution is an
adaptive algorithm that improves recall by using the scores
of already available answers in order to locate peers that are
likely to have even better answers. We verify our approach
on a large, real-world dataset; in particular, we show that
our algorithms achieve good recall even when the communication
cost is low and the number of peers that are contacted
is relatively small.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present
the peer-selection strategy using the two-dimensional histograms.
In Section 3, we develop the two-phase algorithm
that improves the recall at a reduced cost compared to a
more straightforward approach. In Section 4, we present
the adaptive peer-selection strategy. Section 5 describes the
experiments that verify the effectiveness of our algorithms
and includes a comparison with the state of the art. Finally,
we discuss future work and conclude in Section 6.
