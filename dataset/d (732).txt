We characterized and measured various privacy aspects
across eleven OSNs. Users willingly provide personal information
without a clear idea of who has access to it or how
it might be used. The range of privacy settings that OSNs
provide were found to be permissive since default settings
allow access to strangers in all OSNs. We studied how users
make use of privacy controls to limit access and found that
between 55 and 90% of users in OSNs still allow their pro-
le information to be viewable and 80 to 97% of users allow
their set of friends to be viewed. We found a strong negative
correlation between regional network size in Facebook
and the use of these privacy settings to limit access. Much
like traditional Web sites, third-party domains track user
activity pervasively in OSNs.
Various extensions are now feasible. We proposed a new
idea to better match what information a user makes available
with what is needed by other users and applications.
While focusing on regional Facebook networks, we also did
preliminary investigation of a college (5900 users) and a
high school network (2200 users) to which we had access
and found 80% of users allowed their prole to be viewed
for these much smaller networks. Techniques to protect privacy
leakage to third-party domains for traditionalWeb sites
was investigated in [10] and could be extended to OSNs.
Finally looking at privacy implications for interactions between
OSNs, such as between Facebook and Twitter, is another
direction of future work.
