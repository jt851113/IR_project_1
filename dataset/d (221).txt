A part of the software implemented for receiver nodes, called the LocationManager, runs on the host device that has the listener hardware attached to the serial port. The LocationManager listens on the serial port for any data coming from the listener hardware. In our implementation, the MinMode listener inference algorithm to analyze distance estimates is also implemented within the LocationManager, since this provides greater ?exibility. The listener sends both the location information and the measured distance to the corresponding beacon, to the LocationManager for each valid RF reception.
Asynchronous to the reception of distance estimates and listener computations, applications running on the host device connect to the LocationManager and retrieve current location information using a datagram socket (UDP) interface. In fact, this allows for the possibility of obtaining this information from a remote node elsewhere on the network, which might be useful for some applications. We have not yet taken advantage of this facility in our applications
