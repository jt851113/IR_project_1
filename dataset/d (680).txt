Propagation can also be conducted based on the update
frequencies. This process will also try to balance
sensor node workloads using the least possible messages.
Let ns be the number of nodes whose update frequency
is below average. We can choose the first 1
2ns children
with lowest update frequencies, and reduce their bounds
evenly. For example, as shown in figure 2(a), suppose error
bound for c1 is reduced from 20 to 15 by the AP.
If f1 < f2, A1 will be changed from 10 to 5.
We summarize the A3 protocol in figure 4. Note that
since a physical sensor node can host multiple logical
nodes in cluster architecture, multiple copies of the
