The TeleTiny system is related to two major branches of research: database research on continuous queries and
querying data streams and networking projects that discuss routing, data-shipping, and aggregation in sensornetworks.
The most immediately relevant work is the Cougar [36] project from Cornell for querying sensor-networks.
Cougarâ€™s primary focus is on the use of Object-Relational abstractions for querying sensor-based systems rather
than on architectural aspects of sensor query processing. According to [14], the current implementation of the
Cougar system is designed to run on WINS nodes designed by Sensoria Corporation [8], which are large, Linux
based devices that are not subject to the same power or communications limitations as the sensor devices being
developed for the TinyOS project. Indeed, the decision by the Cougar group to use XML to encode messages
between sensors reveals the lack of bandwidth concerns in their environment, suggesting that the tradeoffs and
correct design decisions in Cougar will be substantially different than those in TeleTiny.
