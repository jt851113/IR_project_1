The invocation of a continuous query requires a series of
interactions among the Continuous Query Manager, Event
Detector and Data Manager.
When a timer event happens, the Event Detector first asks the
Data Manager if any of the relevant data sources have been
modified (Step 3 in Figure 4.2). The Data Manager returns a list
of names of modified source files. The Data Manager also
notifies the Event Detector when push-based data sources have
been changed (Step 4 in Figure 4.2). If a continuous query needs
to be executed, its query id and the names of the modified files
are sent to the Continuous Query Manager (Step 5 in Figure
4.2). The Continuous Query Manager invokes the Niagara query
engine to execute the triggered queries (Step 6 in Figure 4.2).
At execution time, the Query Engine requests data from the Data
Manager (Step 7. in Figure 4.2). The Data Manager recognizes
that it is a request for a continuous query and returns only the
delta file (Step 8 in Figure 4.2). Delta files for source files are
computed by performing an XML-specific “diff” operation
using the original file and the new version of the file.
