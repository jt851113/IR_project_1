PISCES requires approximate global statistics, e.g. total number
of nodes N, total query number Nq, query distribution Pq and average
number of nodes joining/leaving Nu. However, in P2P systems,
it is not only costly to collect these statistics, the dynamism of the
system will render any accurate statistics obsolete very quickly.
Sampling techniques have been applied to unstructured P2P networks
in [8, 36]. The sampling algorithm in unstructured P2P networks
try to sample each peer in the same probability. In DHT
network, this issue is no longer a problem for the use of consistent
hashing. By sampling the nodes through randomly generated
IDs, we will sample each node in the same probability. As
shown in Manku’s scheme [27, 26], the estimation error can be
bounded by a constant factor. However, for the overlays supporting
range queries [21, 6, 7], hash function is not adopted and the
above schemes cannot be applied in our case. Thus, in this paper,
we introduce a new sampling scheme to address this problem.
Previous sampling schemes periodically send sampling messages
to the nodes in a random manner. This strategy introduces additional
cost to P2P network. Instead, we decide to exploit the overlay’s
protocol to do the sampling. Our scheme can be applied to
any overlays. For simplicity in description, we again use BATON
as an example.
