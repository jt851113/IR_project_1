In this set of experiments, we examine the performance of
the three algorithms on weighted dominant skyline queries.
When the ratio R of the weights increases, most of the
weight is assigned to a smaller fraction of the dimensions.
If a point is not dominated on those dimensions with heavy
weights, they are very likely to be dominant skyline points
since any subspace with weight sum over w must contain
some of these dimensions. This impact is not large but is
still observable in Fig. 10. TSA and SRA turn out to be
faster on independent and anti-correlated data sets when
the weight ratio is varied from 2 to 5. This improvement in
efficiency is not as significant in correlated data set because
the dominant skyline does not change with the variation
of weights on correlated distribution. Since the dominating
set is independent of dimension weights, no matter what the
weights are, the OSA algorithm stays at the same level in
all three types of data sets.
To summarize, from the experiments on synthetic data
sets, we can conclude that when k, Î´ and Size are small,
TSA is the most efficient algorithm. In other cases, SRA is
faster than the others and has more stable performance on
different data sets.
