In this paper, we propose a new mining problem of partial periodic
pattern with random replacement. To qualify significant
patterns in a sequence, we introduce a new measurement:
generalized information gain. This new metric can seamlessly
accommodate the different frequency of event occurrences
in an event sequence and the gap penalties and provides
us with solid theoretical foundations. The triangle inequality
preserved by the generalized information gain enables us to
devise a linear algorithm to mine the significant pattern in any
subsequence combinations.
