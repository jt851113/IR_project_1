Although the database community has put some effort towards managing data generated from various older sensing technology, the trend towards large wireless sensor networks consisting of hundreds or thousands of tiny, low-power, and lowbandwidth smart sensor devices presents a number of exciting new database challenges. To make sensor networks a ubiquitous technology, the database community must collaborate with sensor network researchers from other ?elds to design unique solutions to manage and process data both inside and outside of sensor networks.
At Berkeley, our sensor network database research has bene?ted tremendously through close collaboration with sensor network researchers and real world users of sensors who are trying to tackle some of the challenges raised in this paper. Though TinyDB [38] has enjoyed some initial successes in both the research community and the sensor network users community, we have only scratched the surface of the diverse set of problems in this space. We look forward to the day when more database researchers become involved in this rapidly emerging and exciting research area.
