DEFINITION 2.2. For an event    and a sequence 
of 
 events, let 	  be the expected probability that 
occurs at any given position in 4. Then the information of
 with respect to  is defined as     
  
	 . The information of the ‚Äúeternal‚Äù event * is
always 05.
In practice, the probability of each event can be determined
in many ways including, but not limited to
	 	  	      	      
 ;
	 	  	
 
 for all    where 
 
and 
 are the number of occurrences of the event  in 
and the length of the event sequence , respectively;
	 	  is determined according to some domain knowledge.
In this paper, we adopt the second option and will not assume
the same probability for every event, i.e. an occurrence of
frequent event carries less information than a rare event. Note
that this also coincides with the original intention of information
in the data communication community.
