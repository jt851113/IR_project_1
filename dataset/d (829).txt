Long term storage is provided in DIMENSIONS by exploiting
the fact that thresholded wavelet coefficients lend themselves to
good compression benefit [5, 6]. Our rationale in balancing the
need to retain detailed datasets for multi-resolution data collection
and to provide long-term storage is that if scientists were interested
in detailed datasets, they would extract it within a reasonable interval
(weeks). Long-term storage is primarily to enable spatiotemporal
pattern mining, for which it is sufficient to store key features
of data. Thus, the wavelet compression threshold is aged progressively
as shown in Figure 3, lending older data to progressively
better compression, but retaining key features of data.
