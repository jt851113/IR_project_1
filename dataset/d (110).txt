I would like to thank Lee Giles for providing the Cite-
Seer query log to me and for his prompt reactions to all my
enquiries about it. Special thanks also go to Florian Holz,
Gregor Heinrich and Sven Teresniak for the excellent discussions
on relative precision; and to Norbert Fuhr who pointed
me into the right direction regarding its final formulation.
