In this paper, we consider the problem of mining proportional FTpatterns.
Moreover, we proposed a depth-first mining approach to mine
proportional FT-patterns efficiently in large database. Unlike PFM algorithm
which generates candidates level by level, we propose a strategy of
generating candidates in a depth first manner to reduce the disk I/O times
when the bitmap of the database can not fit into the main memory. Moreover,
a set of experiments is performed to show the advantage of the approach.
Experimental results indicate that the DFPFM algorithm, by
adopting a depth first mining strategy, can substantially reduce the number
of disk I/O process when the bitmap is too big to fit into memory and
is more scalable than PFM.
