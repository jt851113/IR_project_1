In this section, we discuss the representation of sensor data, as well as the formulation and evaluation of sensor queries in the initial version of COUGAR. We discuss the limitations of this system and the conclusions that we have drawn.  We have introduced in Section 2 a model of sensor database. We took a set of design decisions when implementing this model in the COUGAR system. We distinguish between the decisions we took concerning: 1. User representation: How are sensors and signal processing functions modeled in the database schema? How are queries formulated? 
2. Internal representation: How is sensor data represented within the database components that perform query processing? How are sensor queries evaluated to provide the semantics of long-running queries?
