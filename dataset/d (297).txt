Here are the conclusions that we have drawn from our experience with the initial version of COUGAR: 1. Representing stored data as relations with an ADT attribute representing sensors and sensor data as the output of ADT functions is a natural way of representing a sensor database. 2. Virtual joins are an effective way of executing ADT functions that do not return a value in a timely fashion (because they are often asynchronous, because they generally incur high latency or because they return multiple values over time).  3. Representing all signal processing functions as scalar functions fails to capture the ordering of sensor data in time. As a result, queries involving aggregates over time windows or correlations are difficult to express. This problem has previously been identified in the context of financial data [21].
