Research of routing in ad-hoc wireless networks has
a long history [17, 30], and a plethora of papers has
been published on routing protocols for ad-hoc mobile
wireless networks [25, 16, 5, 26, 24, 8, 15]. All these
routing protocols are general routing protocols and do
not take specific application workloads into account,
although we believe that most of these protocols can
be augmented with the techniques similar to those that
we propose in Section 4. The SCADDS project at USC
and ISI explores scalable coordination architectures for
sensor networks [9], and their data-centric routing algorithm
called directed diffusion [14] first introduced
the notion of filters that we advocate in Section 4.2.
There has been a lot of work on query processing
in distributed database systems [40, 7, 23, 39, 18], but
as discussed in Section 1, there are major differences
between sensor networks and traditional distributed
database systems. Most related is work on distributed
aggregation, but existing approaches do not consider
the physical limitations of sensor networks [33, 38].
Aggregate operators are classified by their properties
by Gray et al. [10], and an extended classification with
properties relevant to sensor network aggregation has
been proposed by Madden et al. [21].
The TinyDB Project at Berkeley also investigates
query processing techniques for sensor networks including
an implementation of the system on the Berkeley
motes and aggregation queries [19, 20, 21, 22].
Other relevant areas include work on sequence
query processing [31, 32], and temporal and spatial
databases [41].
