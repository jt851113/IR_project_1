We focus primarily on two performance measures in exploring the gains and tradeoffs involved in data-centric protocols – energy savings due to aggregation in terms of the number of transmissions, and the aggregation latency. The chief factors that can affect the performance of data aggregation methods are the positions of the sources in the

network, the number of sources, and the communication network topology. In order to investigate these factors, we study two models of source placement, the event-radius (ER) model, and the random sources (RS) model. In both models, we generate a sensor network by scattering n sensor nodes , one of which is a sink node, in a unit square. In the ER model all sources are located within a distance S of a randomly chosen “event” location, whereas in the RS model k random nodes are chosen to be sources. All nodes are assumed to be able to communicate with any other nodes that are within a communication range R.
