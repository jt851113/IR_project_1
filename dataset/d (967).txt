Traditional datasets in multidimensional domains are usually described
as sets of elements (data items) with fixed numbers of attributes. Thus,  denote a dataset containing N elements composed of E attributes,
i.e., 
Definition 2.1 (Embedding Dimension E )
The Embedding Dimension E 2 N of a dataset S is the number of attributes
defining each element of S.
Definition 2.2 (Intrinsic Dimension D)
The Intrinsic Dimension  of a dataset S is the dimensionality of the object
represented by the data, regardless of the dimension of the space in which S is
embedded.
A dataset can represent a spatial object with a dimensionality lower than
or equal to the dimension of the space in which it is embedded. For example,
the intrinsic dimension of a set of points distributed along a line is one, even if
the set is embedded in a space of higher dimension. Figure 3 exemplifies a line
segment in 2 and 3 dimensions.
Note that, if the attributes of a dataset obey uniformity and independence
properties, its intrinsic dimension equals the embedding dimension. On the
other hand, whenever there is a correlation between two or more attributes, the
intrinsic dimension of the dataset is accordingly lower. Thus, D is always smaller
than or equal to E.
Uniformity and independence, however, are rather uncommon properties
in real data. Indeed, experimental evidences have shown that the distribution of
distances between elements in the majority of real datasets is not uniform and
does not follow any of the traditional statistical distributions, such as Gaussian
or Poisson. Instead, most real data present “fractal behavior”.
