In this paper, we motivated the view of a wide area sensor database
as a distributed hierarchical database with timestamped updates arriving
at the leaves. We showed the advantages of using XML as
a data representation, constructing a logical site hierarchy matching
the XML document hierarchy, mapping this logical hierarchy
onto a smaller hierarchy of physical sites, and providing for flexible
partitioning and caching that adapts to query workloads. We
described the many challenges in providing efficient and correct
XPATH query processing in such an environment, and proposed
novel solutions to address these challenges in an effective, flexible,
unified, and scalable manner. New techniques were presented
for self-starting distributed queries, query-evaluate-gather, partialmatch
caching, and query-based consistency. Experimental results
on our IrisNet prototype demonstrated the significant performance
advantages of our approach even for a small collection of sites. We
anticipate that these advantages will only increase when IrisNet is
deployed over hundreds of sites and thousands of miles.
