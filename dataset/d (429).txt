In this paper, we study the problem of surprising periodic
pattern discovery in a data sequence that consists of events
with vastly different occurrence frequencies. Our goal is not
to find the patterns that occur often, but rather to discover
patterns that are surprising. Instead of using the support metric,
we propose a new metric: information gain. Although the
new metric does not possess the Apriori property as the support
metric does, we identify the bounded information gain
property in the information model. Based on the bounded information
gain property, we devise a recursive algorithm for
mining surprising periodic patterns by only exploring extensible
prefixes.
