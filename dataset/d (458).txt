Proposition 2.1 (Triangle Inequality) Given an event se-
quence D and two complementary patterns P and P'of the
same period, let Q be the minimum common super pattern of
P and P'. Then the generalized information gain of D with
respect to Q is at most the summation of that of P and P'.

Proposition 2.1 can be easily generalized to a set of complementary
patterns, which is stated as follows.
