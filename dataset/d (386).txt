No matter what kind of heuristics we use, we do
not expect the prediction to achieve 100% accuracy.
In this case, prediction errors means object missing,
which causes excessive energy overhead for re-locating
the object. To accommodate the prediction errors, a
set of target nodes are waken up to help capturing the
object, instead of only one destination node.
Figure 3: Heuristics for wake up mechanisms
We propose a wake up mechanism that decides the
membership of the target nodes based on the different
levels of conservativeness.
‧ Heuristic DESTINATION. The current node
only informs the destination node. Hence, the
overhead for this heuristic is one node, but with
the higher probability of losing the object.
‧ Heuristic ROUTE. In addition to the predicted
destination, the target nodes also include the
nodes on the route from the current node to the
destination node. This heuristic assumes the direction
is estimated correctly but leaves a room
for errors in speed estimation. Therefore waking
up the nodes on the route can efficiently catch up
the speed changes.
‧ Heuristic ALL_NBR. In addition to the nodes
on the route and the destination node, the current
node also informs the neighboring nodes surrounding
the route, current node and the destination.
This heuristic assumes the prediction of the
moving speed and direction will have observable
difference from the actual values. Thus, waking
up more nodes reduce the probability of objects
missing.
Among the heuristics discussed, All_NBR is the
most conservative one since it assumes the predictions
for both of the speed and directions may
have errors. Thus, it wakes up all the nodes and
neighbors along the predicted route to make up
the deficiency. Heuristics ROUTES and DESTI-NATION
are more energy-efficient since they assume
at lease one of the estimations for moving
direction or speed is correct.
