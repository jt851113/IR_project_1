We now compare the effectiveness of our cost-based distance
function and the standard, similarity-based, cosine distance
function. Our distance function, defined in (3), is based on the
term distributions of both local documents and user queries, while
the cosine distance function is based on only the term distribution
of documents. Also, the cosine distance function is designed to
group semantically “similar” documents, while our distance
function is designed to group documents in a way that minimizes
the query processing cost in (2). The question is whether
traditional text clustering techniques are appropriate for creating
groups that reduce index-building and query processing costs in
DHTs.”
Figure 4 shows that our cost-based distance function is more
effective than the cosine distance function. It outperforms the
cosine distance function for all settings, reducing the total cost by
20% to 25%. We have similar results for other similarity-based
distance functions, such as the KL-divergence and the squared
Jensen-Shannon divergence.
The reason our cost-based distance function outperforms the
similarity-based distance functions is because the groups formed
by the latter are highly unbalanced in size (i.e., the number of
unique terms in each group). In our experiments, the largest group
created by cosine distance, for example, contains 90% of the
unique terms. Therefore, this solution approximates the peer-level
indexing solution, which we have shown to be less efficient for
query processing than our proposed techniques.
