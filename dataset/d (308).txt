As k-dominant skyline query could serve as a good substitute of skyline query on making decisions and allocating resources for cooperative work, in this paper, we propose an ef?cient algorithm SCA for answering k-dominant skyline query by using sorted cumulative information. Moreover, we study the problem of progressive and load balancing distributed kdominant skyline computation and develop a simple yet scalable approach which comes with several nice properties. Extensive experiments using real and synthetic datasets demonstrated the feasibility and efiectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
