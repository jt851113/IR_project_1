To execute simple aggregate queries, sensor nodes have
to send their records to a leader, aggregate them into a
final result, and then deliver the final result to the gateway
node. Note that a sensor node can only communicate
directly with other nodes in its vicinity, limited by
the transmission power of the wireless radio. To send
messages to a distant node, a multi-hop route connecting
the node to the destination has to be established
in advance. A packet is forwarded by internal nodes
along the route until the packet reaches its destination.
Note that this structure is similar in both wired
and wireless networks, but there are major differences.
In a wired network, the network structure is almost
fixed and most routing problems are handled at a few
backbone routers. In a wireless network, such as a
sensor network, limited connectivity requires all nodes
to participate in routing. In addition, the low quality
of the communication channel and frequent topology
changes make the network quite unstable. Thus more
complicated routing protocols are required for wireless
networks.
The networking community has developed many
different ad-hoc network routing algorithms. A separate
routing layer in the protocol stack provides a send
and receive interface to the upper layer and hides the
internals of the wireless routing protocol. In this section,
we show that a routing layer for a query processing
workload has slightly different requirements than
a traditional ad-hoc routing layer, and then we outline
some initial thoughts on how to adapt AODV [26], a
popular wireless routing protocol, to a query processing
workload.
