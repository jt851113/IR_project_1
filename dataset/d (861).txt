
A detailed study of network layouts can be found in [8]. The
specifications and topology of our network is defined by the
following:
Dimension - (X, Y)
Number of nodes - M
Actual node positions -Ai, ? i=1:M. These are the actual
physical location of the nodes. The nodes are normally
distributed around grid points with a variance of σpos.
Known node positions - Ki, ? i=1:M. The known node
positions are each normally distributed around the actual
positions with a variance of σk.
