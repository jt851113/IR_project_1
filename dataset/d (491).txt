5.2.1 Refining Mined Results As a well-known fact, the
number of patterns/rules discovered under the support model
can be very large. Many post-processing techniques have been
developed to reduce the number of discovered patterns into a
manageable size while preserving the discovered knowledge as
much as possible. Human interaction is involved in [12, 22, 23]
to specify the interestingness or beliefs to guide the process
while others [13, 14] focused on reducing redundant information
possessed by the discovered rules. It is clear that these
post-processing techniques are typically used as an additional
pruning step after the normal mining procedure (which produces
a large rule set). In contrast, our proposed scheme successfully
avoids the generation of large number of insignificant/
uninteresting patterns from the beginning and enables a
much more efficient solution.
  Another approach to reduce redundancy is to return only
closed frequent itemset [19, 20, 30]. Intuitively, an itemset is a
closed itemset if all of its supersets have smaller support. While
the set of frequent closed itemsets is typically much smaller,
it has been proved that all frequent itemsets can be uniquely
derived from the set of frequent closed itemsets. Again, this
approach still focuses on mining frequent itemsets and fails to
address the problem we mentioned previously.
