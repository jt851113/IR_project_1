In this section, we show how to use duplicate insensi-
tive sketches to build a robust, loss-resilient framework
for aggregation. First, our algorithm for leveraging the
broadcast nature of wireless communication in combi-
nation with sketching techniques is described in Sec-
tion 4.1. A simple analytic evaluation of the proposed
methods is given in Section 4.2. Finally, practical de-
tails of implementations on sensor motes are given in
Section 4.3.
