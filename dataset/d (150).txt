Our contributions in this paper are as follows:
1. We introduce a new concept, called k-dominant skyline
to alleviate the effect of dimensionality curse on skyline
query in high dimensional spaces (Sec. 3).
2. We propose three different algorithms to solve the kdominant
skyline problem (Sec. 4).
3. We modify the k-dominant skyline algorithm to answer
the top-Î´ dominant skyline query (Sec. 5).
4. We extend the concept of k-dominant skyline to weighted
space and show how our algorithms work on such spaces
(Sec. 6).
5. We show the computational efficiency benefits of these
new concepts through a comprehensive experimental
study (Sec. 7).
