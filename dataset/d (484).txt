4.2 Effects of OIS Pruning Figure 11 (a) shows the difference
of the pruning power of the sophisticated OIS pruning
with superfluous information gain elimination and the segmentbased
OIS pruning. Since the behaviors are similar with different
event sequences, we only show the pruning results for sequence
	. It is evident that the sophisticated one is much
more effective. Although the more sophisticated OIS pruning
requires a little bit more space and time, the result is improved
dramatically. Therefore, we decide that in the remainder of this
section, we use the implementation of the more sophisticated
OIS pruning technique in STAMP.
Figure 11 (b) shows the effectiveness of the more sophisticated
OIS pruning. The y-axis shows the fraction of the MIG
counters that would not be needed. It is evident that when the
generalized information gain threshold  increases, the OIS is
more effective because less events at each period may qualify
for MIG counting. However, even with   , the OIS pruning
can filter out more than 50% of the MIG counters.
