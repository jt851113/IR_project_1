The NECI metasearch engine is currently implemented
for server operation at NEC Research Institute,
where it serves about 100 users. A client implementation
could also be created, which would
improve scalability. The disadvantages are increased
processing and memory requirements, and the need
to update all clients when modifications are made
to the metasearch engine. A client implementation
would also decrease the caching benefits
