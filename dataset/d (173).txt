Peer-to-peer architectures become popular in modern massively distributed systems, which are often in very large scale and contain a huge volume of heterogeneous data. To facilitate the information retrieval process in P2P networks, we consider semantic search approach, where syntax-based queries are shipped to peers based on semantic correlations. Motivated by an interesting experience in Web information retrieval, we propose a novel ontology-based scheme to measure similarity of peer interests accurately and consistently in a decentralized way, and group peers under a scalable hierarchical overlay network. Given queries, our approach either ?oods them within local peer groups or guides them towards remote groups based on the similarity of interests. Our work overcomesthelimitationsoftheexistingP2Phybrid-search approaches by avoiding costly data popularity measurement. Performance evaluation and comparison against baseline algorithms show that our approach provides a better solution for information retrieval in large-scale P2P networks.
