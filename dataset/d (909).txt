In this section we evaluate the performance of the DAB tree
construction based on simulation results; in particular, we
apply DAB to 1D and 2D sensor graphs to show it achieves
better performance than a method which ignores the traffic pattern
information. We first describe a mobility model, called the
city mobility model, that we have developed for the purpose of
generating traffic to support simulation.
