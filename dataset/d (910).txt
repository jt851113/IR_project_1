This model is to simulate large scale object movements
which exhibit locality. As we have argued in the beginning of
the paper, such behavior is likely to occur in some real-world
scenarios.
The model works as follows. The main region in which the
object movements are being tracked is divided into several
smaller subregions, which represent points of interest such as
shopping areas of a city, main squares, etc. These subregions,
which we will refer to as level-1 regions are in turn subdivided
further, representing increasingly local attraction points such as
popular areas of a shopping center, or the sidewalks in a main
square. We will refer to these increasingly nested subregions as
level-2, level-3, etc. The subdivisions continue until some fixed
depth is reached.
Each object travels with a constant speed along a straight
path to its destination. Once it reaches the destination, a new
destination is selected for the object as follows. First, the object
decides with some probability p1 whether to leave its level-1
region. If so, it selects a destination in a neighboring level-1
region uniformly at random. Otherwise, it remains in the same
level-1 region, and repeats the same process at the next lower
level, level-2, with probability p2, and so on until it either
reaches a bottom region or decides to leave a current subregion.
The probabilities pi to leave the current level-i region
decrease with the regionâ€™s size. This forces the object movements
to exhibit locality; they are less likely to embark on long
