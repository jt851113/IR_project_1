In FBQ, the querier x sends out a request to all its immediate neighbors. These nodes in
turn, resolve the query as much as possible based on their information and then forward
the request to all their neighbors and so on. Thus, the request reaches all the nodes in the
network.
In general, as mentioned in Eqn. 8 from section 4.4,
In FBQ:
1. The request for triggered updates will have to be sent as far as R hops away from the
querier x (near the center of the grid) where R is the “radius” of the network i.e. the
maximum number of hops from the center of the grid.
2. d = 0, as the query is not forwarded.
3.  = 0, as the query is completely resolved at the origin of the query itself.
4. SM = 1.
Let Navg(i) be the expected number of nodes at hop i, that can resolve some part of the
query. This can be determined along similar lines as in section 4.2.1:
As before, consider the fetching of information from a sensor as a “trial”. In each “trial”,
the probability of success is p = M
N and the probability of failure is q = N?M
N . The number
of successes is a binomial random variable. The total number of “trials” at hop i is N(i).
Thus, the expected number of successes at hop i is given by
The response of each of the Navg(i) nodes will be forwarded over i hops.
Thus, for FBQ, Eavg is given as follows:
For a grid with X nodes, R =
p
X. Thus, For a given M, N and c, Eavg / X3/2.
