In-network data aggregation is essential for wireless sensor networks where resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy)
are limited. In a previously proposed data dissemination scheme, data is opportunistically aggregated at the
intermediate nodes on a low-latency tree which may not necessarily be energy efficient. A more energy-efficient
tree is a greedy tree which can be incrementally constructed by connecting each source to the closest point of the
existing tree. In this paper, we propose a greedy approach for constructing a greedy aggregation tree to improve
path sharing. We evaluated the performance of this greedy approach by comparing it to the prior opportunistic
approach. Our preliminary result suggests that although the greedy aggregation and the opportunistic aggregation
are roughly equivalent at low-density networks, the greedy aggregation can achieve signficant energy savings at
higher densities. In one experiment we found that the greedy aggregation can achieve up to 45% energy savings
over the opportunistic aggregation without an adverse impact on latency or robustness.
