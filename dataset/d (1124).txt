The Aurora user interface cannot be covered in detail because of space limitations. Here, we mention only a few salient features. To facilitate designing large networks, Aurora will support a hierarchical collection of groups of boxes. A designer can begin near the top of the hierarchy where only a few superboxes are visible on the screen. A zoom capability is provided to allow him to move into specific portions of the network, by replacing a group with its constituent boxes and groups. In this way, a browsing capability is provided for the Aurora diagram
Boxes and groups have a tag, an argument list, a description of the functionality and ultimately a manual page. Users can teleport to specific places in an Aurora network by querying these attributes. Additionally, a user can place bookmarks in a network to allow him to return to places of interest.
These capabilities give an Aurora user a mechanism to query the Aurora diagram. The user interface also allows monitors for arcs in the network to facilitate debugging, as well as facilities for “single stepping” through a sequence of Aurora boxes. We plan a graphical performance monitor, as well as more sophisticated query capabilities
