In addition to the moving behavior of tracked objects,
we also study the impact of sensor components on energy
saving schemes for OTSNs. We vary two control
parameters, i.e., sampling duration and sampling
frequency, to observe their effect on total energy consumption
and missing rate. Due to the space constraint,
the figure of missing rate is not shown.
