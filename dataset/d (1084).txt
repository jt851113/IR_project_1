We have proposed a novel location-tracking protocol for regular and irregular sensor networks. A
mobile-agent approach is adopted, which enables agents to roam around to follow the moving objects,
hence significantly reducing the communication and sensing overheads. A data fusion model
is proposed, and several data delivery strategies are proposed and evaluated. We have prototyped a
system based on the idea using IEEE 802.11b NICs, where signal strengths are used as the criterion
to measure objects’ positions. While the prototyping is proved to work correctly, the accuracy still
has rooms to be improved further.
