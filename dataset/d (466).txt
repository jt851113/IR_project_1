DEFINITION 2.1. A pattern with period  is an array of 
events       , each of which is either an event in 
or *, i.e.,          . We say that the th
position is instantiated if   . For any two patterns
	         and 	   
 
     
 of the same
period , 	 is a superpattern of 	  (	 is a subpattern of 	)
if 
   or   
 , for all     .
Note that an event can appear at multiple positions in a
pattern. For example,      is a pattern of period 5
and its first, second and fifth positions are instantiated. It is also
a superpattern of     .
