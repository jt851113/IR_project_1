All query expansion methods used in experiments are based
on local context analysis (LCA, see [30]) in a slightly modified
version. There are two changes w.r.t. the original LCA
formulation in [30]
‧ The computation of idf values is done as described
above.
‧ In the original work on LCA, expansion concepts are
defined as noun phrases. We relax this definition and
allow arbitrary index terms as concepts.
The general expansion strategy LCA is used with three
types of expansion collections:
‧ The web: queries are passed to the API of the Yahoo!
web search engine and the top 10 results are retrieved.
The “passages”, from which expansion terms are taken,
are the snippets that the search engine returns as a
summary of the result page.
‧ Local pseudo feedback: As an alternative to these global
resources, a local expansion strategy as described in [8]
is implemented that first ranks peers using the original
query, retrieves the 10 best results returned by the
top-ranked peer and feeds them into LCA.
‧ Global pseudo feedback: Instead of using documents
only from the top-ranked peer, this strategy assumes
knowledge of the whole distributed collection and uses
the 10 best results that a centralised system would
return. This strategy serves as an upper baseline for
the other two query expansion strategies: although it
cannot be applied in a P2P setting, it can serve to
show how effective pseudo feedback could be if we had
complete knowledge.
