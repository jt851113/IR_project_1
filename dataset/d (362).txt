TD-DES also provides an integrated network construction
layer, which organizes a wireless network into a tree
topology. The topology is constucted by broadcasting advertisements
from all nodes in the network. Initially the
root node broadcasts a parent advertisement. Each node
that hears the advertisement replies with a child message
that indicates that the node is willing to become a child of
the root. Whenever a node becomes a child, it broadcasts its
own parent advertisement. The process continues until all
the nodes get attached to the tree. A node that hears multiple
parent advertisements chooses as its parent the node
with the lowest hop count to the root. This style of tree
construction is not novel and has been commonly used by
other work [5, 16, 26].

are given at the upper left of each node, effective
subscriptions at the upper right. Arrows indicate
the links over which the event is broadcast.
The tree construction layer is adaptive to changes in the
topology that result from node failures, additions, and mobility.
The layer does not provide point-to-point messaging
capabilities (e.g., using globally unique idâ€™s such as IP
addresses) as do traditional routing protocols [21, 29, 30],
but rather provides a means of disseminating data events
throughout the network to all interested parties based on
per-node event subscriptions. This publish/subscribe style of
event-based communication is the data dissemination model
of choice because it effectively decouples the producers and
consumers of information, making it well-suited for dynamic,
ad-hoc environments.
