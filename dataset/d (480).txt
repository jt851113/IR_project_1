3.4 Pattern Verification The verification process of a candidate
pattern 	         of period  is similar to that to
compute the MIG counts. The event sequence      is first
mapped to a list of real numbers as follows. Each segment of
 events 	 	     	 is examined at a time. It is
mapped to a positive number 	 if it supports 	. Otherwise,
a negative number  is mapped from each violated position
of . Then, a similar procedure to MIG computing can be
applied to locate the subsequence that maximize the generalized
information gain of the pattern. Figure 8 shows the validation
of pattern   . The bracketed subsequence is the one that
provides the maximum generalized information gain . Note
that multiple subsequences may have the same generalized information
gain. If that is the case, our algorithm will output the 
first one11.
