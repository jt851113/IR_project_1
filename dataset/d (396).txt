Sampling frequency is the number of sampling performed
during a reporting period. To meet the application
requirement, a sensor node has to perform
sampling at least once per reporting period. However,
increasing the sampling frequency at a sensor
node may increase the freshness of an objectâ€™s moving
history (for AVERAGE and EXP AVG prediction
models), but reduce the duration the node can turn
to sleep and thus save energy. Thus, sampling frequency
represents a tradeoff between the accuracy of
predictions and the cost of sensing operation. With
a small prediction period (i.e., sleep time), the probability
that an object stays in the same speed and
direction is high; thus, the prediction is more likely
to be correct. However, a higher sampling frequency
also implies unnecessary monitoring (because the results
are not needed for reporting).
Figure 8 shows that the energy consumption is linearly
increased when the sampling frequency is increased.
However, the missing rate (not shown here)
is dramatically decreased. Based on our simulation
result, the missing rates of the PES scheme with all
three wakeup heuristics are below 1% when the sampling
frequency equals to 3. However, continue to increase
the sampling frequency is not a good strategy,
because the extra operation cost will eventually overwhelm
the gain achieved by the higher prediction accuracy.
As we observed from the above figure, all the
PES schemes consume more energy than CM at some
point. From this experiment, we can deduce that the
sampling frequency is a tunable parameter between
energy consumption and objects missing rate that may
worth further study.
