We propose a simple profile language that permits highlevel
expression of a userâ€™s data needs for the purpose of
expressing desirable contents of a cache. We consider techniques
for cache prefetching on the basis of profiles expressed
in our framework, both for basic and preemptive
prefetching, the latter referring to the case where staging a
cache can be interrupted at any point without prior warning.
We examine the effectiveness of three techniques in particular:
a greedy approach, a randomized approach (simulated
annealing), and branch-and-bound, and show that the
greedy approach is fast and effective for moderately sized
profiles, but that the randomized approach scales better for
shared caches with extremely large superprofiles. We view
this work as a migration of data management ideas and
techniques, characterized by their use of data and application
semantics to drive the management of shared resources,
into the wide-area network setting. We believe that profiles,
as described in this paper, are an enabling technology that
could spawn a rich new area of research beyond cache management
into network data management in general. The use
of rich, declaratively specified profiles to drive data management
policy promises benefits similar to the profound
effect that declarative queries had on database system technology.
This paper is a first step in that direction.
