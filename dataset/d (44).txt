A sensor node has one or more sensors attached that
are connected to the physical world. Example sensors
are temperature sensors, light sensors, or PIR sensors
that can measure the occurrence of events (such as the
appearance of an object) in their vicinity. Thus each
sensor is a separate data source that generates records
with several fields such as the id and location of the
sensor that generated the reading, a time stamp, the
sensor type, and the value of the reading. Records
of the same sensor type from different nodes have the
same schema, and collectively form a distributed table.
The sensor network can thus be considered a large distributed
database system consisting of multiple tables
of different types of sensors.
Sensor data might contain noise, and it is often possible
to obtain more accurate results by fusing data
from several sensors [12]. Summaries or aggregates of
raw sensor data are thus more useful to sensor applications
than individual sensor readings [21, 10]. For
example, when monitoring the concentration of a dangerous
chemical in an area, one possible query is to
measure the average value of all sensor readings in that
region, and report whenever it is higher than some predefined
threshold.
