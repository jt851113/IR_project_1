A model is needed for the false events at the sensor nodes. These
could be caused by interference from objects not of interest,
background phenomena, and faulty sensors. A simple model
incorporating many of these phenomena would be a discrete
Bernoulli i.i.d. random process at each node with probability of
occurrence p at each time interval Î¶ of the simulation.
