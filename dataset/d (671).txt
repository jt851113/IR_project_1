In this paper, we develop an energy efficient approach
to processing continuous aggregate queries in sensor networks
with bounded quality constraints. Specifically, we
exploit quality-aware in-network aggregation of query information
to reduce communication costs. Given cluster
structures over sensor nodes, we develop an adaptive
approximate data processing protocol to aggregate
data and process queries given error tolerance on user
queries. The protocol enforces group quality constraints
on clusters and adjusts error bounds to balance workload
of clusters and reduce communication cost. It also tries
to initiate local communication instead of global communication
in the effort of minimizing overall communication
overhead. Our experimental results indicate that
significant benefits can be achieved by using our adaptive
protocol.
