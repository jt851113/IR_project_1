A pre-processing phase takes place on each peer independently
of other peers. This phase includes typical techniques used in IR,
such as document parsing, stop-word removal, tokenization, and
calculation of local TF/IDF scores based on the peer’s local contents
only. Obviously other IR techniques or weight computation
schemes can be employed, however in this paper we assume peers
use TF/IDF. Then each peer runs a clustering algorithm on its local
documents. Since local document clustering can be a costly process
for a peer with many documents, it is left to the individual
peers to decide how often this process should be performed, based
on the rate of content change, so it does not necessarily have to be
performed each time the global clustering process occurs.
In the end of this phase, each peer can provide to the network a
set of clusters representing its local data. Each cluster c is represented
by a feature vector F of tuples Fi = (fi,wi, tfi, dfi,Di),
where each tuple contains a feature/term fi, the term’s weight wi,
the term frequency tfi and document frequency dfi, and the number
of documents Di represented by this feature vector. Although
the set of terms and their respective weights are sufficient to represent
the term’s importance in the cluster, we keep some extra information
in each tuple, in order to enable accurate weight computation
in subsequent phases, as will be shown shortly.
