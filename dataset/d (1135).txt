As of June 2002, we have a prototype Aurora implementation. The prototype has a Java-based GUI that allows construction and execution of Aurora networks. The interface is currently primitive, but will be extended over the next few months to support specification of QoS graphs, connection points, and zoom. The run-time system contains a primitive scheduler, a rudimentary storage manager, and code to execute most of the boxes. Aurora metadata is stored in a schema, which is stored in a Berkeley DB [1] database. Hence, Aurora is functionally complete, and multi-box networks can be constructed and run. However, there is currently no optimizer and load shedding. We expect to implement Aurora functionality in these areas over the course of the summer.
