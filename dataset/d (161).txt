Since the Two-Scan algorithm maintains only candidate
k-dominant skyline points but not the free skyline points
that are not k-dominant, it is not possible to precisely maintain
the maxkdom(.) values as in the extended One-Scan approach.
Instead, we apply a binary search technique to determine
the smallest k value such that .
The details are given in Algorithm 5.
Although the Two-Scan algorithm might be invoked log(|S|)
times in the worst case, when the minimum value of k for
 to hold turns out to be small (which

is necessary when Î´ is small), Theorem 4.2 indicates that
the Two-Scan algorithm and hence its extended variant are
very efficient due to the pruning effectiveness of the dominant
skyline points.
