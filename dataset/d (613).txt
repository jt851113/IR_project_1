In this paper, we have presented the AlvisP2P proto-
type for scalable full-text P2P-IR that uses carefully selected
indexing term combinations associated with possibly trun-
cated posting lists. The two presented indexing approaches
(HDK and QDI) overcome the scalability problem of single-
term retrieval in structured P2P networks, while preserving
a retrieval quality fully comparable to state-of-the-art cen-
tralized search engine. The developed AlvisP2P prototype
implements modules for distributed indexing, retrieval, and
content-based ranking. This demonstration software repre-
sents a contribution to the design, development and research
of realistic P2P search engine systems.
