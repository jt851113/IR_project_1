We classify the related work into three categories: query
processing, view management and routing and MAC protocols.
Query Processing in Sensor Networks. Several research
groups have focused on in-network query processing as a
means of reducing energy consumption. The TinyDB Project at
Berkeley investigates query processing techniques for sensor
networks including an implementation of the system on the
Berkeley motes and aggregation queries [30], [32], [33],
[29], [21]. An acquisitional approach to query processing
is proposed in [31], in which the frequency and timing of
data sampling is discussed. The sensor network project at
USC/ISI group [22], [19], [18] proposes an energy-efficient
aggregation tree using data-centric reinforcement strategies
(directed diffusion). A two-tier approach (TTDD) for data
dissemination to multiple mobile sinks is discussed in [47].
In a recent study [13], an approximation algorithm has been
designed for finding an aggregation tree that simultaneously
applies to a large class of aggregation functions.
Although there has been a lot of work on query processing
in distributed database systems, [51], [5], [34], [50], [25],
there are major differences between sensor networks and
traditional distributed database systems. Most related is work
on distributed aggregation, but existing approaches do not
consider the physical limitations of sensor networks [41],
[46]. Aggregate operators are classified by their properties by
Gray et al. [15], and an extended classification with properties
relevant to sensor network aggregation has been proposed by
Madden et al. [32].
View Management in Sensor Networks. Our high-level
framework for distributed storage builds on the data-centric
storage model proposed in [39], [40] and extended in [12].
Long-term storage in sensor networks is combined with multiresolution
data access and spatiotemporal data mining in [9].
There has been a lot of work on view design, maintenance
and exploitation in centralized database systems. Chaudhuri
et al. [7], [2] consider the automated selection of materialized
views and indices given a query workload and discuss their
implementation on Microsoft SQL Server. Valentin et al.
propose the DB2 Advisor which includes an index recommendation
module, and provides measurements on the quality
of the recommended indexes [43]. Several variations of the
view selection problem have been extensively studied in the
context of data warehouses: although the general goal is to
select views that would minimize the query response time,
the constraints under consideration is either the materialization
time, the storage space or both [16], [3], [17], [24]. Kotidis
et al. propose a dynamic view management system for data
warehouses (DynaMat [26]), which unifies the view selection
and the view maintenance problems under a single framework.
Algorithms for query rewriting and making efficient use of
existing materialized views to speed up query processing are
discussed in [27], [38], [14].
Routing and MAC Layers in Sensor Networks. The data
management layer should not be considered in isolation from
the communication layers. For instance, an opportunity for
cross-layer optimization is to design and adapt communication
protocols to the particular communication needs of the data
management layer. A number of protocols for ad-hoc networks
have been proposed in the literature [35], [23], [4], [36].Recent
work on energy-aware routing proposes the selection of routes
on the basis of available energy in order to increase network
lifetime[6], [52], [37]. Heinzelman et al. present the
SPIN family of network protocols for communication of large
messages in sensor networks [20]. The PAMAS MAC-level
protocol turns radios off when they are not transmitting or
receiving packets [42]. TDMA protocols reduce the duty cycle
thus trading idle-time energy consumption for latency [37].
Our wave scheduling approach achieves significantly greater
energy savings by coordinating the radio usage across the
sensor network.
An energy-efficient MAC protocol called S-MAC has been
proposed in [48], [49], where the nodes are locally synchronized
to follow a periodic listen and sleep scheme. GAF (Geographical
Adaptive Fidelity) [45], [44] is an algorithm that also
conserves energy by identifying nodes that are equivalent from
a routing perspective and then turning off unnecessary nodes.
Our wave scheduling protocol is orthogonal and synergistic to
GAF.
