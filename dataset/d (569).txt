We make the assumption that each active node forwards the resolved query to another node
that is exactly d hops away, requiring d transmissions. Hence the average energy spent in
answering a query of size M is given as follows:
where  is the expected number of hops from the node where the query is completely resolved
to the querier x.9 This is the cost of returning the completed response back to the querier
node. This response can be returned along the reverse path in which case  can be atmost
dSM. Thus,
