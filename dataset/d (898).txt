Progress in miniaturization has allowed researchers to build
networked sensors, increasingly compact devices that combine
the functionality of sensors, radios, and processors [1, 5, 8].
Their low cost and wireless communication capability make it
feasible to deploy them in large numbers, and without preexisting
infrastructure. With more sensors available in the
environment, it is more likely that phenomena of interest are
near some sensors, thereby leading to the main appeal of wireless
sensors compared to the tethered ones. On the other hand,
such sensors rely on limited sources of power, and so energy
efficiency becomes an important feature of the systems that use
them.
Tracking consists of detecting and monitoring locations of
real-world objects, possibly using several types of sensing such
as acoustic, seismic, electromagnetic, etc. Numerous applications
of tracking are currently in use; for example, air traffic
control, fleet tracking, habitat monitoring, mobile telephony,
etc. Networked sensors have recently been used for this purpose
[2].
We are interested in designing an efficient tracking method,
based on networked sensors, that has the ability to cover large
regions of interest by using many sensors with small detection
range. The method will need to handle a large number of moving
objects at once. To address the scalability goals, we use
hierarchical organization, similar to schemes previously used
in cellular telephone systems [6]. We focus on improving the
energy efficiency of such schemes.
