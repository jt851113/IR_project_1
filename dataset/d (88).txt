1. INTRODUCTION
In distributed information retrieval (DIR, [5]), a central
instance, often called broker receives user queries, forwards
them to a selection of IR databases and then merges the
results returned by these into a final ranking.
In peer-to-peer information retrieval (P2PIR), there is no
central instance (cf. e.g. [11]). Rather, each peer has knowledge
of the addresses of a small number of other peers, its
neighbours. In order to retrieve information in a P2PIR system,
a peer that receives a query searches its local database
for matching data items and then forwards it to a subset
of its neighbours, which will proceed in the same way until
some stopping criterion is met. The entire process of for-

warding user queries in a P2P network is often called query
routing.
The task of selecting only a subset of information resources
from all available ones is motivated – in both cases –
by the wish to reduce costs: in DIR, selecting a large number
of resources is costly because it may take a long time
and cause overload on the selected databases – which may
actually charge the user for each returned result.
In P2PIR, cost is most often measured in the number of
messages that is generated by a query. A high number of
messages results in the underlying physical network becoming
slow and overloaded.
