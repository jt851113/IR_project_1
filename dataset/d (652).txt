We now describe FM sketches for the distinct count-
ing problem.
Denition 2 Given a multi-set of items M =
fx1; x2; x3; : : : g, the distinct counting problem is to
compute n  jdistinct(M)j :
Given a multi-set M, the FM sketch of M, denoted
S(M), is a bitmap of length k. The entries of S(M),
denoted S(M)[0; : : : ; k ??1], are initialized to zero and
are set to one using a random binary hash function h
applied to the elements of M. Formally,
S(M)[i]  1 i 9x 2 M s:t: minfj j h(x; j) = 1g = i:
By this denition, each item x is capable of setting a
single bit in S(M) to one { the minimum i for which
h(x; i) = 1. This gives a simple serial implementation
which is very fast in practice and requires two invoca-
tions of h per item on average.
Theorem 1 An element xi can be inserted into an FM
sketch in O(1) expected time.
We now describe some interesting properties of the
sketches observed in [7].
Property 1 The FM sketch of the union of two multi-
sets is the bit-wise OR of their FM sketches. That is,
S(M1 [M2)[i] = (S(M1)[i] _ S(M2)[i]):
Property 2 S(M) is entirely determined by the distinct
items ofM.Duplication and ordering do not aect S(M).
Property 1 allows each node to compute a sketch
of locally held items and send the small sketch for ag-
gregation elsewhere. Since aggregation via union oper-
ations is cheap, it may be performed in the network
without signicant computational burden. Property 2
allows the use of multi-path routing of the sketches for
robustness without aecting the accuracy of the esti-
mates. We expand upon these ideas in Section 4.
The next lemma provides key insight into the be-
havior of FM sketches and will be the basis of eAcient
implementations of summation sketches later.
Lemma 1 For i <
with probability.
Proof: This lemma is proven in [7] and follows from
basic balls and bins arguments.
The lemma implies that given an FM sketch of n
distinct items, one expects an initial prex of all ones
and a suAx of all zeros, while only the setting of the
bits around S(M)[log2 n] exhibit much variation. This
gives a bound on the number of bits k required for
S(M) in general: k = 3
2 log2 n bits suAce to repre-
sent S(M) with high probability. It also suggests that
just considering the length of the prex of all ones in
this sketch can produce an estimate of n. Formally, let
Rn  minfi j S(M)[i] = 0g when S(M) is an FM
sketch of n distinct items. That is, Rn is a random
variable marking the location of the rst zero in S(M).
In [7], a method to use Rn as an estimator for n is de-
veloped using the following theorems.
Theorem 2 The expected value of Rn for FM sketches
satises E(Rn) = log2('n) + P(log2 n) + o(1); where
the constant ' is approximately 0:775351 and P(u) is a
periodic and continuous function of u with period 1 and
amplitude bounded by
Theorem 3 The variance of Rn for FM sketches, de-
noted 2n
, satises 2n
= 2 1
+ Q(log2 n) + o(1); where
constant 2 1
is approximately 1:12127 and Q(u) is a pe-
riodic function with mean value 0 and period 1.
Thus, Rn can be used for an unbiased estimator of
log2 n if the small periodic term P(log2 n) is ignored.
A much greater concern is that the variance is slightly
more than one, dwarng P(log2 n), and implying that
estimates of n will often be o by a factor of two or
more in either direction. To address this, methods for
reducing the variance will be discussed in Section 3.3.
