The role assignment algorithm has to be aware of the following
aspects of a WASN:
Node Heterogeneity: A given node may take on multiple
roles. Some nodes may be resource rich compared to others.
For example, a particular node may be connected to a permanent
power supply. Clearly, such nodes should be given more
priority for taking on transmission-intensive roles compared to
others.
Power Constraint: A role assignment algorithm should minimize
data communication since data transmission and reception
expend more power than computation activities in wireless
sensor networks [7]. Intuitively, since the overall communication
cost is impacted by the location of data aggregators, the
role assignment algorithm should seek to find a suitable placement
for the fusion points that minimizes data communication.
Dynamic Behavior: There are two sources of dynamism in
a WASN. First, the application may exhibit dynamism due to
the physical movement of end points or change in the transmission
profile. Second, there could be node failures due to
environmental conditions or battery drain. So far as the placement
module is concerned, these two conditions are equivalent.
In either case, the algorithm needs to find a new mapping of the
task graph onto the available network nodes.
