For finding frequent itemsets, a data stream can be defined as
follows:
?) Let I={i1, i2, … , in} be a set of current items that have ever
been used as a unit information of an application domain.
?) An itemset e is a set of items such that e?(2I-{?}) where 2I
is the power set of I. The length |e| of an itemset e is the
number of items that form the itemset and it is denoted by
an |e|-itemset. An itemset {a,b,c} is denoted by abc.
?) A transaction is a subset of I and each transaction has a
unique transaction identifier TID. A transaction generated
at the kth turn is denoted by Tk.
?) When a new transaction Tk is generated, the current data
stream Dk is composed of all transactions that have ever
been generated so far i.e., Dk = <T1, T2, … , Tk> and the
total number of transactions in Dk is denoted by |D|k.
When a transactions Tk is generated currently, the current count
Ck(e) of an itemset e is the number of transactions that contain the
itemset among the k transactions. Likewise, the current support
Sk(e) of an itemset e is the ratio of its current count Ck(e) over |D|k.
A decay rate means the reducing rate of a weight for a fixed
decay-unit. A decay-unit determines the chunk of information to
be decayed together. A decay rate is defined by two parameters: a
decay-base b and a decay-base-life h. A decay-base b determines
the amount of weight reduction per a decay-unit and it is greater
than 1. When the weight of the current information is set to 1, a
decay-base-life h is defined by the number of decay-units that
makes the current weight be b-1. Based on these two parameters, a
decay rate d is defined as follows:
Theorem 1. Given a decay rate d = b?(1/ h) (b>1, h?1, b-1? d< 1),
the total number of transactions |D|k in the current data stream Dk
is found as follows:
(Proof)
When the first transaction is looked up, the number of transactions
|D|1 is obviously 1 since there is no previous transaction whose
weight should be decayed. When the second transaction is looked
up, the total number of transactions |D|2 is computed by |D|1×d+1
since the weight of the first transaction is decayed. Subsequently,
when a new transaction is generated at the kth (k?2) turn, the total
number of transactions |D|k=|D|k-1×d+1. Consequently, it can be
expressed by |D|k=dk-1+dk-2 + …+d+1= (1? d k ) /(1? d) . Since b-1?
d<1, |D|k converges to 1/(1? d) as k increases infinitely. □
Similarly, the count Ck(e) of an itemset e in the current data
stream Dk is obtained as follows:
