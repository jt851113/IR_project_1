The contribution made by this work is twofold:
‧ So far, the trade-off between absolute profile size and
retrieval effectiveness has not been evaluated thoroughly
for P2PIR. The studies in DIR [18, 6] explore just one
or two values for profile size and the only study in
P2PIR [3] does not use absolute profile sizes.
‧ So far, many advanced solutions to collection selection
and query routing have been proposed and most
of them have been evaluated in isolation. There have
been comparative evaluations in DIR [10], but, to the
best of my knowledge, this is the first evaluation that
compares a selection of approaches against each other
in a unified P2PIR evaluation setting, including methods
for profile adaptation that have not been explored
in DIR.
