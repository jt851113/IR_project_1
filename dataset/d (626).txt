We have proposed a distributed algorithm for organizing
sensors into a hierarchy of clusters with an objective of
minimizing the total energy spent in the system to
communicate the information gathered by these sensors to the
information-processing center. We have found the optimal
parameter values for these algorithms that minimize the energy
spent in the network. In a contention-free environment, the
algorithm has a time complexity of O(k1 + k2 + ... + kh ) , a
significant improvement over the many O(n) clustering
algorithms in the literature [2,3,4,8,9]. This makes the new
algorithm suitable for networks of large number of nodes.
In this paper, we have assumed that the communication
environment is contention and error free; in future we intend to
consider an underlying medium access protocol and investigate
how that would affect the optimal probabilities of becoming a
clusterhead and the run-time of the algorithm.
