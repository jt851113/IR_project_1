As previously mentioned, the user profile is built from the
history of accessed documents. We plan to evaluate several
recently proposed techniques to select representative keywords
for a user profile [7, 23, 24]. When using profiles in
the clustering algorithm, we have to deal with the problem
of too general or too specific profile representations w.r.t to
the user’s interest topics. Important parameters include the
time window that controls the evolution of user profiles, the
number of profiles maintained, as well as the number of keywords
in a profile. The settings of the Bloom filters (number
of bits, number of hash functions, number of inserted elements)
also need to be analyzed for finding good trade-offs
between false positive ratio and profiles’ accuracies.
Notice that in the feedback content, we do not take into
account the relevance scores provided by the search engine
because they are too heterogeneous and difficult to aggregate.
We could, however, derive interesting information
from the rank of document in the results lists, the order
in which the users visits the documents, or the duration between
successive accesses in the result list
