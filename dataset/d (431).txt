Most previous work on periodicy detection has focused on
mining synchronous periodic patterns and does not recog-
nize misaligned presence of a pattern due to the interven-
tion of random noise. In this paper, we propose a more
exible model of asynchronous periodic patterns that may
be present only within a subsequence and whose occurrences
may be shifted due to disturbance. Two parameters min rep
and max dis are employed to specify the minimum num-
ber of repetitions that is required within each segment of
non-disrupted pattern occurrences and the maximum al-
lowed disturbance between any two successive valid seg-
ments. Upon satisfying these two requirements, the longest
valid subsequence of a pattern is returned. A two-phase
algorithm is devised to rst generate potential periods by
distance-based pruning, followed by an iterative procedure
to derive and validate candidate patterns and locate the
longest valid subsequence.
