Recent years have seen signicant work on best-
eort routing routing in sensor and other wireless net-
works. Due to high loss rates and power constraints, a
common approach is to use multi-path routing, where
more than one copy of a packet is sent to the desti-
nation over dierent paths. For example, directed dif-
fusion [13] uses a ood to discover short paths which
sensors would use to send back responses. Various pos-
itive and negative reinforment mechanisms are used to
improve path quality. Braided diusion [8] builds on di-
rected diusion to use a set of intertwined paths for in-
creased resilience. A slightly dierent approach is used
by GRAB [22], where paths are not explicitly chosen,
but the width of the upstream broadcast is controlled.
Our techniques are meant to complement and lever-
age any of these routing techniques. We note that
combining these methods with duplicate-insensitive in-
network aggregation will allow some of the overhead of
these techniques to be amortized and shared amongst
data items from many dierent sensors.
