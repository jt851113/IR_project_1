As we mentioned earlier, the correlation in the readings of
sensors in a sensor network may be spatial, temporal, or
spatio-temporal. A wide range of techniques based on PRE-
MON paradigm may be used to exploit each type of correla-
tion. In this paper we focus primarily on exploiting spatio-
temporal correlation. Our interest is in approaches that may
be used over a wide range of sensor types. At the same time,
we realize that the domain knowledge would play a signi-
cant role in giving nal shape to the specic technique used,
based on these approaches.
Spatio-temporal correlation is typically present in sensor
networks sensing a moving phenomenon. For example con-
sider a network of motion sensors. When an object passes
through the eld of these motion sensors, the readings of
sensors along its path are very likely temporally correlated.
In this paper, we propose techniques to exploit this type of
correlation.
