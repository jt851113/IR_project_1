There are four primary differences between sensor based data sources and traditional database sources which
make standard query processors poorly suited for querying sensor data. First, sensors typically deliver data in
streams: they produce data continuously, often at well defined time intervals, without having been explicitly
asked for that data. Queries over those streams need to be processed in near real-time, as data arrives, partly

because it may be extremely expensive to save raw sensor streams to disk, and partly because sensor streams
represent real-world events, like traffic accidents and attempted network break-ins, which need to be responded
to. The second major challenge with processing sensor data is that sensors are fundamentally different from the
well engineered data-sources typical in a business DBMS. They do not deliver data at reliable rates, the data
is often garbled, and they have limited processor and battery resources that the query engine needs to conserve
whenever possible. Third, sensors are general purpose computing devices, not just blind producers of data and
can thus be used to partially compute queries as data flows through them. Finally, sensors are typically connected
together in ad-hoc networks that cover a geographic area larger than the radio range of a single sensor, such that
receiving data from arbitrary parts of the network requires the sensors to agree on a multi-hop transmission
protocol and coordinate to route and process each otherâ€™s data.
