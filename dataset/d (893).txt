Figure 9 shows the average battery energy consumption
of each node in the network. We use the average energy
consumption of the flooding approach as the baseline. The
IA approach is much more efficient in energy saving than
the other two approaches. Energy consumption is highly related
to the total number of communication messages shown
in Figure 6. More message transfer in the network consumes
more energies. Eureka incurs more energy consumption than
the flooding approach, because of its index dissemination
and query propagation. In every single query step of Eureka,
it floods the query to all neighbors. Although only
one or a few neighbors with higher index values will further
flood the query, many neighbors just do nothing but drop
the messages, and hence the energies are wasted on these
nodes. Additionally, the index update in Eureka involves
the majority of nodes in the network, which introduces high
energy cost.
