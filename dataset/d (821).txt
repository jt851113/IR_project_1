As the form factor of computing and communicating devices
shrinks and the capabilities of such devices continue to grow, it
has become reasonable to imagine applications that require rich
computing resources today becoming viable candidates for future
sensor networks. With this futuristic assumption, we have
embarked on designing APIs for mapping fusion applications
such as distributed surveillance on wireless ad hoc sensor networks.
We argue that the proposed framework will ease the
development of complex fusion applications for future sensor
networks. Our framework uses a novel distributed role assignment
algorithm that will increase the application runtime by
doing power-aware, dynamic role assignment. We validate our
arguments by designing a sample application using our framework
and evaluating the application on an iPAQ based sensor
network testbed.
