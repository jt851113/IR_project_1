3.1 MIG Counting We first consider the issue of how to generate
the MIG for a singular pattern,            , where
the MIG serves as an estimate of the maximum achievable generalized
information gain based on the maximum repetition of
the singular pattern in a given sequence. We find that the problem
of evaluating the MIG for a singular pattern on an event sequence
      , is equivalent to discover the maximum
summation of any subsequence of a sequence of real numbers
derived from the event sequence based on the singular pattern.
The generalized information gain of an event sequence  with
respect to a pattern 	 is 	    	  	. If
	 is a singular pattern             of period , then
	  . We can partition  into segments of length .
The information loss on a segment that does not support 	 is
. Let  be the number of segments that do not support 	.
The generalized information gain of  with respect to 	 can be
rewritten as 	      . More specifically, each
segment is associated with  if it supports 	 and  otherwise.
Therefore, we can map the event sequence  (with 

events) into a sequence of  
  real numbers       
 .
As shown in Figure 2, the sequence of real numbers with respect
to    is 1.33, -1.33, 1.33, 1.33, -1.33, 1.33, and
1.33. Now the problem becomes finding the maximum summation
of any subsequence of       
 . The maximum
information gain problem can be then formulated as follows [2].
where  and  are the maximum value of the summation of
any subsequence ending exactly at  and the maximum value
of the summation of any subsequence ending either before or
at  , respectively. By choosing 	  	 and 	  	, the
MIG of             is equal to 
  	.
This forward recurrence can be easily solved by making one
scan through the event sequence and maintaining two counters
for each singular pattern to capture  and  at the current
scanning position. The starting position and ending position
of the corresponding subsequences can also be maintained
simultaneously [2]. Since the number of MIG counters is
  

, and the main memory of a common computer
is limited to a few hundred MBytes which could be far less than
  

, we need a mechanism to limit the number of
MIG counters considered before the MIG counting procedure.
