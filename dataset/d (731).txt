There has been considerable work in the privacy and anonymization
eld on traditionalWeb sites related issues. There
is a growing amount of literature [2, 6, 17] on OSNs as well,
although the focus is on examining identity leakage due to
attacks or data being published. We focus on the scenario
where no additional information is actively released about
social network data and with no explicit adversary. However,
the work on re-identication [4] that allows one to relate
supposedly anonymous data with actual identities by
combining external data is related. In OSNs it is easier to
get various bits of private information and each of them can
be used to merge with external information to identify a person.
Given the recent large-scale attempts to have medical
records online, such concerns are well-motivated.
Privacy protection measures exist for Web browsing in
the form of well known extensions in Firefox, anonymized
access etc. However, in the presence of voluntary information
provided by users, what matters most is limiting the
access. Strong co-operation is needed by the OSN and their
guiding policies will be a key factor in protecting user privacy.
The recent withdrawal by Facebook of default opt-in
to beacons whereby visits by users of certain third party ecommerce
sites could trigger automatic notication to their
OSN friends, is a step in the right direction.
