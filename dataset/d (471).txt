DEFINITION 2.6. Given a pattern 	 with period  and a sequence
 of 

 
  events:       , the information
loss of  with respect to 	 is the summation of the information
loss of each segment 	 	     	 with
respect to 	. The generalized information gain of  with respect
to 	 is defined as 	  	    	 where
	, 	, and 	 are the information of 	, the support
of 	 within , and the information loss of  with respect to 	,
respectively.
In a subsequence, the first match of a pattern is viewed
as an example, and only subsequent matches contribute to the
generalized information gain7. With the generalized information
gain concept, letâ€™s consider the event sequence  
                 .
In this sequence, the information of the occurrence of   is
	  	 while the information of the occurrence
of  is 	  . The generalized information
gain of    in subsequence          is
3.46 while the generalized information gain of    in subsequence
            is 1.38. This is
due to the fact that event  occurs much more frequent than ,
and hence it is likely that    also occurs frequently in the
event sequence. On the other hand, event  occurs relatively
scarce, thus the occurrence of    carries more information.
Therefore, if    is specified as the generalized information
gain threshold, then pattern    would satisfy the
threshold, but not   . However, with the traditional support
confidence thresholds,    always has higher support
value than   .
