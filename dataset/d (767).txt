Tracking is a common problem in sensor
networks when we wish to monitor discrete
entities rather than continuous fields. For
example, one may want to track the locations
of personnel in a failing structure to facilitate
evacuation. Leveraging location information,
we have developed a tracking service based
on binary-detection proximity sensors and
linear trajectory prediction (Mechitov et al.
2003). Since our service does not require
fine-grained distance measurements between
sensors and entities being tracked, nor a specific
sensing modality, it can be applied to a
wide range of problem scenarios.
Our approach makes use of the computational
capabilities of each sensor node to
predict the possible locations of the target
over time. The measurements and predictions
from each of the sensors are combined at a
single designated node. For example, given a
known maximum detection radius and the
time when a sensor first encounters the
tracked object, it is safe to assume that the
tracked object is at the maximum detection
distance from the sensor. If the tracked object
moves according to a linear trajectory, the
longer the duration that the object spends in a
sensor's detection region, the closer it would
have had to pass by that sensor. We build on
this idea to estimate the distance from a sensor
to the object. Thus we calculate its
approximate location with a weighted average
of the detecting sensors' coordinates, where
the inverses of these distance estimates are
used as weights. This weighted average can
be computed efficiently inside the network
during data aggregation. In order to predict
the movement of the subject over time, we fit
a linear trajectory estimate to the set of most
recent location estimates.
