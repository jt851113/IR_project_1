In this paper, we focus on mining periodic patterns allowing some degree
of imperfection in the form of random replacement from a perfect
periodic pattern. Information gain was proposed to identify patterns
with events of vastly different occurrence frequencies and adjust for
the deviation from a pattern. However, it does not take any penalty
if there exists some gap between the pattern occurrences. In many
applications, e.g., bio-informatics, it is important to identify subsequences
that a pattern repeats perfectly (or near perfectly). As a solution,
we extend the information gain measure to include a penalty
for gaps between pattern occurrences. We call this measure as generalized
information gain. Furthermore, we want to find subsequence
such that for a pattern
the generalized information gain of
in is high. This is particularly useful in locating repeats in DNA
sequences. In this paper, we developed an effective mining algorithm,
InfoMiner+, to simultaneously mine significant patterns and the associated
subsequences.
