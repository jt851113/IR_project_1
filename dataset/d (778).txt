We introduced the problems of view selection, aggregation
tree selection, and node scheduling in a sensor network, and
presented a high-level description of our approach to solving
them. In future work, we plan to investigate the interaction
between these three problems. We are interested in exploring
efficient wave schedules given specific message generation
patterns, view locations, and aggregation trees. Another interesting
direction is to study fault-tolerance in the context of
materialized views and scheduled data propagation.
