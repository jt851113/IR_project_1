Figure 1 presents a functional view of the system. Queries
to some existing search engine and to the CFRS are sent in
parallel; results are then ranked by structural information
or user-based relevance information. Queries to the CFRS
are accompanied by the interest profile of the user, which is
used to customize the result list according to his interests.
Relevance information is gathered on the user’s machine by
observing accesses to elements returned by any of the search
methods.
On the user side it is necessary (1) to build appropriate
interest profiles for improving search results relevance
(user interest profiling); (2) to present the results returned
by the CFRS (user interface); and (3) to provide a mechanism
for inserting new relevance information, based on the
user’s local accesses to elements from the results lists (relevance
feedback tracker).
On the collaborative retrieval service side, mechanisms are
needed (1) to direct requests and relevance tracking information
to the relevant node(s) in the network (routing) and
(2) to compute lists of relevant items for queries, based
on relevance tracking information and user interest profiles
(storage and ranking, denoted by storage layer in the paper).
The architecture of the system and the main interactions
between its elements are depicted in Figure 2. The next
sections describe its major components (shown in grey in
the figure).
