We also evaluate the impact of parameters on the movielens
data set with equal weights in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b).
Although TSA and SRA are much faster than OSA on kdominant
skyline query, they cannot beat OSA on top-Î´
dominant skyline query because of the large dimensionality
of the data set. For TSA, the binary search on large k
consumes too much time to locate the best level of k. For
SRA, too many different top rated movies by different users
reduces its pruning efficiency.
On the movie-lens data set, we also try two different weight
assignments. With the equal weight assignment to every
user, five top movies are found and listed in the first column
of Table 4. When the weights for every user is set proportional
to the number of movies he or she rated, we see some
different results in the second column. The difference comes
about because, in the movie-lens data set, most users have
rated only a small fraction of the movies. If we give equal
weights to all users, a movie A has advantage over another
movie B only if more users rated A, no matter how many
users like B more than A. Since the data set was collected
from 1997 to 1998, 4 out of 5 top dominant skyline points
of equal weight are movies from 1996 to 1997, which had
been just watched by the users. From the result in second
column, we believe this problem is alleviated in the biased
weight assignment.
With heavier weights on the users with more ratings, the
computation times of TSA and SRA increase in Fig. 12(c),
since the data set is so sparse that those heavily weighted
users can have very few common movies rated, which makes
it even harder to find dominant skyline points.
