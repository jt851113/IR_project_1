Abstract—Recently, as more and more social network data
has been published in one way or another, preserving privacy
in publishing social network data becomes an important concern.
With some local knowledge about individuals in a social
network, an adversary may attack the privacy of some victims
easily. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies on privacy
preservation can deal with relational data only, and cannot be
applied to social network data. In this paper, we take an initiative
towards preserving privacy in social network data. We identify
an essential type of privacy attacks: neighborhood attacks. If an
adversary has some knowledge about the neighbors of a target
victim and the relationship among the neighbors, the victim may
be re-identified from a social network even if the victim’s identity
is preserved using the conventional anonymization techniques.We
show that the problem is challenging, and present a practical
solution to battle neighborhood attacks. The empirical study
indicates that anonymized social networks generated by our
method can still be used to answer aggregate network queries
with high accuracy.
