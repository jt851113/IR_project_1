In an Expanding ring search, at stage 1, the querier x will request information from all
sensors exactly one hop away. If the query is not completely resolved in the first stage, x
will send a request to all sensors two hops away in the second stage. Thus, in general at
stage i, x will request information from sensors exactly i hops away. The average number of
stages tmin taken to completely resolve a query of size M can be approximately determined
by the First order analysis in section 4.2.1:
tmin can be determined by solving the above quadratic equation (taking the ceiling if necessary
to get tmin as an integer).
In ERS, at stage i, all nodes within i?1 hops of the querier x will forward the x’s request.
Let Navg(i) be the expected number of nodes at hop i that will resolve some sub-query. The
response from these nodes will be forwarded over i hops. There are a total of tmin stages.
Thus, the total update cost is given as follows:
Navg(i) can be computed as follows:
At the ith step, f(i?1) nodes would already have been requested for their information. The
expected number of queries resolved Mr(i ? 1) before the ith step can be given as follows:
Thus, in the ith step, the probability of “success” is given by
Thus, in step i, the expected number of nodes that will resolve some sub-query is given by:
Since the query is not forwarded to any other node,
