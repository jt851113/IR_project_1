When the information of a transaction is rapidly decayed, the
resulting set of recently frequent itemsets may be too sensitively
varied since it is dominated by the itemsets of newly generated
transactions. This type of fluctuation in the set of frequent
itemsets is meaningless. In order to avoid this, a safety factor γ is
introduced. It is defined by the maximum number of most recently
generated consecutive transactions that contains a new itemset
while the itemset remains as an infrequent itemset. The resulting
set of recently frequent itemsets in a data stream Dk becomes
stable when the decay-base-life h of a decay rate  is
set to be greater than or equal to its lower bound   defined in
Theorem 2. If a decay-base-life h is less than its lower bound hLB,
an itemset whose current count is less than the safety factor γ may
become a frequent itemset.
Theorem 2. Given a minimum support Smin, a safety factor γ and a
decay-base b, the decay-base-life h of a decay rate 
should be greater than or equal to its lower bound  defined as
follows:
(Proof)
When a new itemset e appears in most recently generated γ
consecutive transactions in a data stream Dk, its
. Consequently, its support Sk(e) is always
greater than 
since the maximum value
of . The itemset should not be a frequent itemset
for the given safety factor γ, so that its support should be always
less than the minimum support Smin. Therefore, 
should be satisfied.  , the lower bound of a
decay-base-life hLB is found as follows:
 .
