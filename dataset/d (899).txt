In order to aid the task of designing methods for tracking
objects across large areas, we discuss the expected characteristics
of large-scale traffic patterns. A popular mobility model
used for several ad hoc network protocols [4, 7] consists of
nodes that move uniformly across a region under study, in
order to approximate small-scale scenarios where the movements
are expected to be random and close to uniform. Examples
of such scenarios are visitors at a convention, rescue teams
at a disaster site, etc.
We postulate that large-scale movement patterns are not
likely to be uniform, because large-scale real-world environments
usually have inherent structure that makes this infeasible.
For example, a downtown area of a city may consists of a
street grid and buildings that prevent pedestrians from moving
around arbitrarily. Further, it is uncommon for a city-dweller to
roam around uniformly at random; a more likely trajectory
consists of spending time within some local region, and occasionally
making long-range transitions.
As a second example, consider a large-scale disaster recovery
or battlefield scenario. It may be unusual for every participant
to move uniformly across the entire field; rather, due to
organizational structure, the movement may be constrained so
that there is little traffic between different units, while movement
within units is quite high.
Finally, let us examine a large natural habitat, such as a
national park, that scientists may wish to monitor [2]. Once
more, it is unlikely to observe animals moving around uniformly.
The animals may be living in herds; different types of
animals may avoid trespassing upon each othersâ€™ territory; or
there may be various natural obstacles like hills or undergrowth
that restrict movement in certain regions, etc.
The common characteristic of the above three examples is
movement locality. This observation provides support for our
design in later sections.
