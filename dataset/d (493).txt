5.2.3 Statistically Significant Patterns There are much
work in discovering statistically significant patterns [5, 18, 27].
All those work only takes into account the occurrence of a pattern
in a sequence or a transaction. However, it does not assign
any penalty if a pattern fails to be present when it is supposed
to. In addition, all those work only discovers the significant
patterns for the entire data set, and does not identify the subsequence
(subset) where a pattern is significant.
