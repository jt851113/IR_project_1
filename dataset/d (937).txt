Exact Threshold-based top-k algorithms could be the solution for
searching in modern p2p applications that maintain and use
ranked data. The new extended versions HT-p2p and HT-p2p plus
presented in this paper show promising results in terms of
bandwidth consumption which is the most crucial parameter as
the size of p2p networks increases. Ongoing work includes the
precise assessment of the time performance of HT-plus in a fullydistributed
simulation platform. ,It is also interesting to study the
support of non-monotonic aggregation functions in order to enrich
the query capabilities.
