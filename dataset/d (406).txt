It has been argued in [14] that a group of sensors (possibly
of dierent types) is more eective in performing a sens-
ing task than one powerful sensor. This argument favors a
sensor network with a large number of sensors. In such a
sensor network, a group of spatially proximate sensors are
very likely to have correlated readings. The correlation may
be spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal. Also, these three
types of correlations are not mutually exclusive and they
may be present in varying degrees in a sensor network. We
aim to exploit this correlation. We believe that in many
instances one can predict a sensor's reading based on the
recent history of readings of the sensors around it and based
on its own recent history. The sensor need not transmit
its reading when it can be predicted by the monitoring en-
tity. This gives us a new paradigm of operation in sensor
networks. We call this the PREdiction-based MONitoring
(PREMON) paradigm. The basic paradigm is as follows:
the base station monitors the reading of sensors and gener-
ates prediction-models3. It sends these to the appropriate
sensors. On receiving a prediction-model sensors change
their behavior | instead of sending an update whenever
their reading changes, they now send an update only when
their readings dier from the one predicted by the prediction
model.
