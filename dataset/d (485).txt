4.3 Effects of MIG Counting The number of candidate patterns
depends on the average number of events (with positive
MIG values) in each position of each period. Figure 12(a) shows
the average number of events (&) in each position for period ()
between 5 and 100 with the generalized information gain threshold
  . (Note that the Y-axis is in log scale.) The & value
is similar for all four data sets and & decreases with . In Figure
12(a), when  ! 	, & '  for all four sequences. In other
words, many positions of a pattern with period larger than 30
are null. The total number of candidate patterns (() for each
period between 5 and 100 is illustrated in Figure 12(b). ( increases
with  when  ' 	 due to the longer periods. On the
other hand, ( decreases with  when  ! 	 due to the smaller
number of possible events in each position.
