A k-dominant object has the following a priori property.
Theorem 1. Any (k?1)-dominant object must be a k-dominant object for any
k such that 1 < k ? n.
Theorem 2. Any k-dominated objects cannot be a (k ? 1)-dominant object for
any k such that 1 < k ? n.
Proof. Based on the definition, a (k ? 1)-dominant object p is not (k ? 1)-
dominated by any other objects in X. It implies that p is not k-dominated by any
other objects. Therefore, we can say p is k-dominant object. On the other hand,
if an object q is k-dominated by another object, it must be (k ? 1)-dominated
by the object. Therefore, q cannot be a (k ? 1)-dominant object.
The conventional skyline is the n-dominant skyline. If we decrease k of the
k-dominant skyline, more objects are eliminated. For example, N1 and N8 of
Table 1 are not in skyline because they are dominated (n-dominated) by N2.
So, they canâ€™t be a candidate of k-dominant skyline object for k < n. We can
prune such non-skyline objects for further procedure of the k-dominant query.
If we consider 5-dominant query, N3, N5, N6, and N7 are 5-dominated objects
in addition to the 6-dominated objects, N1 and N8. Therefore, we can prune
those objects in 5-dominant query computation. Thus, by decreasing k, more
dominated objects can be pruned away.
