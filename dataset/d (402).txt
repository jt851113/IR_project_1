We rst describe the model of sensor networks considered
in this paper and state our assumptions about it. We then
describe the mechanisms based on PREMON paradigm for
performing energy-eAcient monitoring in sensor networks,
in section 3. We have implemented these mechanisms in a
test bed of sensors. In section 4, we describe the experiments
we have performed and the results we have obtained. In sec-
tion 6, we present the related work in the eld and contrast
our approach. In section 7, we briey describe the scope
for future work in this area and present our conclusions in
section 8.
