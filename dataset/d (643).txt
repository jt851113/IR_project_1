As discussed in section 3, in approximate aggregate
monitoring, two invariances need to be maintained to ensure
correctness of the final result. Our protocol has been
illustrated using the invariance for SUM query as shown
in equation 1. The Average (AV G) query has similar invariance
and shares a similar protocol. The invariances
for MAX/MIN queries are different and in fact less complicated.
For MAX queries, the invariances are
Invariance 11 indicates that we should set error tolerances
for all child nodes at a same value. Since cluster-head
will take the maximum, it is only advantageous to set
all nodes to the maximum error bound. This further implies
that all nodes in the AT share the same error bound.
With identical error bound, the adjustment component
of the protocol disappears. A cluster-head only needs
to monitor the maximum default value among its child
nodes. To do this, a cluster-head keeps in its cache all default
values of its children. When it receives new values
from some children in a specific round (which implies
error bound violations occur with these nodes), it resets
the corresponding default values in its cache. Next, if
the maximum value among all the cached default values
is changed from the previous round, the new maximum
value is sent to its parent node. Note the protocol is simpler
since, besides identical error bounds, there is no need
for a parent node to reset default values of its children.
The default values are automatically set at their reported
values. MIN aggregates can be monitored with exactly
the same protocol.
