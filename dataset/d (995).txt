To determine the neighborhood of the start set the algorithm
needs to follow links that point in and out of
these documents. Outlinks are easily obtained by fetching
the document. One way of obtaining inlinks is to use
AltaVista queries of the form link : u, which returns a
list of documents that point to the URL u. This was the
implementation used by [21].
In our queries, the neighborhood graph contained on
the order of 2000 nodes. The running time is completely
dominated by the time it takes to fetch the documents.
With a download rate of 1 document per second queries
takes about 30 minutes.
To get fast access to linkage information within the
World Wide Web, we built a Connectivity Server [4] that
provides linkage information for all pages indexed by the
AltaVista search engine. The server provides a specialized
interface to compute the neighborhood graph for a
set of URLs. This speeds up the graph construction to
under half a minute and enables us to handle queries in
almost real time.
We ran the computation for 150 iterations in each
case, although the system seemed to converge after 10.
