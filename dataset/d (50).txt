The two main tasks of a routing protocol are route discovery
and route maintenance. Route discovery establishes
a route connecting a pair of nodes when required
by the upper layer, and route maintenance repairs the
route in case of link failures. Many wireless routing
protocols have been proposed and implemented,
mostly aimed at ad-hoc networks. A distributed and
adaptive routing protocol, in which nodes share the
routing decision and nodes can change routes according
to the network status, is more suitable to sensor
networks. Such protocols can be further classified
into proactive, reactive and hybrid routing protocols.
Proactive routing protocols, like DSDV [25], may set
up routes between any pair of nodes in advance; while
reactive routing protocols create and repair routes only
on demand. Hybrid routing protocols, e.g. ZRP [11],
combine both properties of proactive and reactive protocols.
AODV is a typical reactive routing algorithm. It
builds routes between nodes only as desired by the application
layer. There are several reasons why we use
AODV as the routing protocol for our study. First,
reactive routing protocols scale to large-size networks,
such as sensor network with thousands of nodes. Second,
AODV does not generate duplicate data packets,
which is a requirement to do in-network aggregation
for duplicate-sensitive aggregate operators. Finally,
AODV is a popular ad-hoc network routing protocol
and it is implemented in several simulators. Although
our discussion is based on AODV, our observations
apply to other routing protocols as well.
