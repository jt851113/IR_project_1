The data allocation problem on the disk storage has been
widely studied in the past. As the application of data
broadcast in the mobile environment becomes popular, the
issue of data allocation on the broadcast channel for
reducing the access latency receives much attention. In this
paper, the database broadcast issues are discussed and the
idea of the access graph is introduced to represent the data
objects with a certain relationship. Moreover, heuristics are
proposed to determine the broadcast order for data objects
whose relationship is represented by an access graph. This
problem can be proven to be NP-complete. We propose a
heuristic to solve the problem based on the techniques of
solving two well-known problems, the maximum branching
problem and optimal linear ordering problem. We transform
the access graph to a set of access trees, each of which can be
arranged into an optimal broadcast order. Then, we merge
these broadcast orders to form the final result. We take the
effect of each removed edge from the access graph into
consideration, which makes our approach more effective.
Our proposed algorithm can deal with any access graph with
different sizes of data objects. Experiments show that our
approach has good performance. In the future, we will
consider the data allocation problem on multiple broadcast
channels and the issue of using data replication to increase the
availability of popular data objects.
