In situations where computational resources are
severely constrained, it may be desirable to re-
duce the cost of performing insertion operations
with summation sketches. We now briey men-
tion some tradeos in the computational time at the
cost of increased communication and decreased accu-
racy. While this is unlikely to be desirable in sensor
networks, given the high power costs of commu-
nication relative to computation, it may be desir-
able in other settings where there are large numbers
of items per node.
Suppose that the largest value being inserted is
bounded by yx. Insertions with the algorithm described
already take O(x2 log2 y) time. We can instead use x
dierent summation sketches, each corresponding to a
dierent digit of the ci's using radix y. To add a ci
value, each digit of ci is inserted into the correspond-
ing sketch, taking expected O(x log2 y) time, and esti-
mates are made by summing the counting sketch esti-
mates with the appropriate weights. The accuracy of
this approach is essentially the same as before, and the
increase in space is bounded by a factor of x.
An alternative approach for reducing the space over-
head is to replace FM sketches with the very recently
developed \loglog" sketches of [5]. The reduction of
Section 3.2 can be applied similarly, again with small
eects on accuracy. In parallel with our work, the
sketches of [1] were adapted to summations in [17], but
their methods involve both logarithms and exponenti-
