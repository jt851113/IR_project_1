The patterns in √ói=1.. are called n-sets. They associate n subsets of elements
from the n domains of the relation. For the sake of clarity, an n-set (Si )i=1..n will
often be represented by ‚à™i=1..n Si (without loss of generality, the attribute domains Di
are considered disjoint). For example, given an n-set S = (Si )i=1..n and an element
e ? ‚à™i=1..nDi , we write:
Let us formalize the union and the inclusion on n-sets.
Definition 1 (n-set union ) Given two n-sets S = (Si )i=1..n ? √ói=1..n2Di and
T = (T j ) j=1..n ? √ój=1..n2Dj , S  T = (S1 ‚à™ T 1, . . . , Sn ‚à™ T n).
Definition 2 (n-set inclusion ) Given two n-sets S = (Si )i=1..n ? √ói=1..n2Di and
T = (T j ) j=1..n ? √ój=1..n2Dj , S  T ? S1 ? T 1 ? ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ? Sn ? T n.
Notice that, by definition, the union of two n-sets is the n-set with the minimal envelope
enclosing both of them. The inclusion of n-sets is useful to define a closedness
constraint.Closed n-sets in n-ary relations (n ? 2) generalize closed itemsets in binary
relations: the closed 2-sets are the closed itemsets associated to their supporting sets
of transactions or objects, i. e., the so-called formal concepts (Ganter et al. 2005). The
generalization of the definition towards n-ary relations is natural. Considering the 0/1
representation of the n-ary relation (such as RE in Table 1), a closed n-set is a maximal
hyper-rectangle of ‚Äò1‚Äôs modulo arbitrary permutations of the hyperplanes (i. e.,
the hyperplanes of a pattern need not be contiguous).
In the following, when X denotes an n-set,we assume X = (Xi )i=1..n ? √ói=1..n2Di .
Definition 3 (Closed n-set) Given an n-set X, X is a closed n-set iff it satisfies the
two following constraints:
- Cconnected(X) ‚â° √ói=1..n Xi ? R;
- Cclosed(X) ‚â° ?X ? √ój=1..n2Dj , X  X ? Cconnected(X
) ? X = X.
According to the first constraint, Cconnected, taking one element from each of the
subsets constituting a closed n-set is constructing an n-tuple that is in R. The second
constraint, Cclosed, tells that X is closed if any strictly larger pattern (more elements
from any domains) violates Cconnected. It is, for Cconnected, a closure property on the
n subsets of D1, D2, . . . and Dn altogether. It can easily be proved that an equivalent
closedness constraint only forces the patterns with one more element (from any
domain) to break Cconnected. Furthermore, because Cconnected ensures the presence in
R of every n-tuple in √ói=1..n Xi , checking the closedness constraint can be reduced
to searching for absent n-tuples involving this additional element only.
Definition 4 (Closed n-set (equivalent definition)) Given an n-set X, X is a closed
n-set iff it satisfies the two following constraints:
- Cconnected(X) ‚â° √ói=1..n Xi ? R;
- Cclosed(X) ‚â° ?i = 1..n, ?s ? Di \ Xi ,
?Cconnected(X1, . . . , {s}, . . . , Xn), i.e., X1√ó¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑√ó{s}√ó¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑√óXn ? R.
Example 1 In RE , represented in Table 1, ({Œ±, Œ≥ }, {1, 2}, {A, B}) is a closed 3-set:
{Œ±, Œ≥} √ó {1, 2} √ó {A, B} ? RE (in Table 1 there are ‚Äò1‚Äôs at the intersection of all
the related hyperplanes);
Every pattern with one more element violates Cconnected:
- ?Cconnected({Œ≤}, {1, 2}, {A, B}), i.e., {Œ≤} √ó {1, 2} √ó {A, B} ? RE ;
- ?Cconnected({Œ±, Œ≥ }, {3}, {A, B}), i.e., {Œ±, Œ≥} √ó {3} √ó {A, B} ? RE ;
- ?Cconnected({Œ±, Œ≥ }, {4}, {A, B}), i.e., {Œ±, Œ≥} √ó {4} √ó {A, B} ? RE ;
- ?Cconnected({Œ±, Œ≥ }, {1, 2}, {C}), i.e., {Œ±, Œ≥} √ó {1, 2} √ó {C} ? RE .
({Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ }, {1, 2}, {A}) and ({Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ }, {1, 2, 3, 4}, ?) are two other examples of closed
3-sets in RE .
Considering, again, a ternary relation that stands for customers buying items along
months, a closed 3-set is a maximal subset of customers buying the same maximal
subset of items during a maximal subset of months. Such a pattern is useful for analyzing
buying behaviors. The closedness constraint filters out all strict ‚Äúsub-patterns‚Äù
(i. e., patterns where some elements are removed and none are added) of the largest
ones that are extracted. The justification for this constraint is the same as with itemset
mining: a lossless (Boulicaut and Bykowski 2000) reduction of the output, which
keeps themost informative pattern of every equivalence class (Gallo et al. 2009).With
collections of n-sets, a ‚Äúlossless condensation‚Äù means that, whatever j = 1..n and
given any (n ? 1)-set X ? √ói=1..n?i =j 2Di , all elements in Dj that relate with every
combination of n ? 1 elements taken from the n ? 1 subsets of X can be derived
from the closed n-sets only. They are the largest set of elements in Dj a closed n-set
associates with an (n ? 1)-set larger than X (w.r.t. the  order).
