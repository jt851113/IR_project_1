We implemented various strategies for aggregation
and transmission using the TAG simulator. Under each
of these strategies, each node aggregates results re-
ceived from its children with its own reading, and then
sends the aggregate to one or more of its parents. Any
node within broadcast range which was at a lower level
(closer to the root) was considered a candidate parent.
In particular, we used the following methods in our ex-
periments:
TAG1: The main strategy of [15] (each sensor sends
its aggregate to a single parent).
TAG2: The \fractional parents" strategy of [15] de-
scribed in Section 2.2.
LIST: The aggregate consists of an explicit list of
all the items in the aggregate with any duplicates re-
moved. These lists are sent to all parents.
SKETCH: The strategy described in Section 4 us-
ing duplicate insensitive sketches. The default values
for sketches is 20 bitmaps and 16 bits in each bitmap
using the PCSA technique.
For our basic experimental network topology, we
used a regular 30  30 grid with 900 sensors, where
each sensor was placed at each grid point. The com-
munication radius was p2 (allowing the nearest eight
grid neighbors to be reached) and the default link loss
rate was set at 5%. The root node is always at the cen-
ter of the grid. Figure 1 illustrates an example of 77
grid.
In all the graphs, we show the average values of 500
runs. Also, for each average value, we show the 5th and
95th percentiles.
