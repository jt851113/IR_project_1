We have started to implement a prototype of our query
processing layer in the ns-2 network simulator [4]. Ns-2
is a discrete event simulator targeted at simulating network
protocols to highest fidelity. Due to the strong interaction
between the network layer and our proposed
query layer, we decided to simulate the network layer
to a high degree of precision, including collisions at
the MAC layer, and detailed energy models developed
by the networking community. In our experiments, we
used IEEE 802.11 as the MAC layer [36], setting the
communication range of each sensor to 50m and assuming
bi-directional links; this is the setup used in
most other papers on wireless routing protocols and
sensor networks in the networking community [14].
In our energy model the receive power dissipation is
395mW, and the transmit power dissipation is 660mW
[14]. (This matches numbers from previous studies.)
There are many existing power-saving protocols that
can turn the radio to idle [35, 27], thus we do not take
the energy consumption in the idle state into account.
Sensor readings were modeled as 30 bytes tuples.6
