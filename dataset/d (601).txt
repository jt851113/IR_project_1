Our DocumentGrouping algorithm in Section 4.1 is based on a
“cost-based” distance function defined in (3). The distance
function estimates the cost increase by assigning a document to a
group. This cost-based distance function is different from other
distance functions that are normally used in document clustering,
which measure the similarity between a document and a group. As
alternatives, we also consider these “similarity-based” distance
functions commonly used in the field of Information Retrieval
below.
Cosine distance: the cosine distance of a group Gij and a
document dik is measured based on the cosine of their angular
separation when Gij and dik are represented as term frequency
vectors. The cosine distance between Gij and dik is computed as
one minus their cosine similarity:
In this expression, V(Gij) is Gij’s representation as a term
frequency vector, (‧) is the dot product, and ||V(Gij)|| is the length
of V(Gij).
We also tried other distance functions (e.g., the KL-divergence
[28] and the squared Jensen-Shannon divergence [29]), but
without significantly different results.
