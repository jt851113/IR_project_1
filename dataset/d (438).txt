In this paper, we propose a exible model of asynchronous
periodic patterns to mine patterns that are of any length and
may only be present within a subsequence, and whose occur-
rences may be shifted due to disturbance. Two parameters
min rep and max dis are employed to qualify valid patterns
and the longest valid subsequence is returned for each valid
pattern. A two-phase algorithm is devised to rst generate
potential periods by distance-based pruning, followed by an
iterative procedure to derive and validate candidate patterns
and locate the longest valid subsequence.
