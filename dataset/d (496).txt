Detecting bursts in data streams is an important and challenging
task. Due to the complexity of this task, usually burst detection
cannot be formulated using standard query operators. Therefore,
we show how to integrate burst detection for stationary as well as
non-stationary data into query formulation and processing, from
the language level to the operator level. Afterwards, we present
fundamentals of threshold-based burst detection. We focus on the
applicability of time series forecasting techniques in order to dynamically
identify suitable thresholds for stream data containing
arbitrary trends and periods. The proposed approach is evaluated
with respect to quality and performance on synthetic and real-world
sensor data using a full-fledged DSMS.
