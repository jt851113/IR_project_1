PISCES distinguishes itself from traditional P2P networks in
three ways. First, nodes employ database systems to organize their
data. Nodes can adopt different DBMS and customize their database
designs. Data sharing amongst nodes is also via tuples of databases.
Second, PISCES establishes some mapping servers outside P2P
networks. These mapping servers translate various usersâ€™ schemas
into a uniform mediated one. Third, in PISCES, nodes apply a partial
indexing strategy to disseminate their data, and hence greatly
reduce the overhead of disseminating data.
