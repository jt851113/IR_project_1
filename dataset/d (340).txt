SON creation is a multi-phase distributed process that runs recursively
on specific sets of peers. Having as a starting point the initial
unstructured P2P network, some initiator peers are selected in
a pseudo-random way (initiator selection phase). Initiators create
local topological zones over their neighboring peers (zone creation
phase). Then each initiator collects the cluster descriptions of all
peers in its zone, and executes a clustering algorithm in order to create
new clusters that span the entire zone (zone clustering phase).
Since the clusters of two (or more) peers may be merged into a new
cluster, this implies that these peers become members of a SON,
and the SONâ€™s contents are now represented by a new cluster description.
In the subsequent steps, the initiators form the current
(unstructured) P2P network, thus playing the role of peers in the
initial setup. Therefore, the process described above runs on the initiators,
thus new initiators are selected, that create zones and cluster
zone contents in a completely similar way as shown above. Hence,
zones and clusters are merged recursively until global clusters are
obtained. Conceptually, the overlay creation steps are shown in
Figure 1.
