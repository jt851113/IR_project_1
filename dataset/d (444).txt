Note that an event can appear at multiple positions in a pattern.
For example,
 is a pattern of period 5 and
its first, second and fifth positions are instantiated. It is also a
superpattern of
We found that the information measure [1] which is widely
studied and used in information theory field fulfills the first
two properties. It is hence used to measure the amount of positive/
negative influence to the overall significance of a pattern
caused by each occurrence/absence. Based on it, we devise a
novel measurement, generalized information gain, to quantify
the significance of a pattern within a subsequence of events.
The following is the definition of the information and the generalized
information gain.
