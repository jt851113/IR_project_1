The sampling duration needed to obtain required data
for a moving object directly decides the energy consumption
by MCU and sensor components. As shown
in Figure 7, the increase of sampling duration has a
noticeable effect on PES with various wakeup heuristics,
but not on CM. Meanwhile, the missing rates (not
shown here) are low and decreasing linearly when the
sampling duration increases. For PES, the longer a
sensor node samples its detection area, the shorter it
can turn to sleep for energy saving. On the other hand,
this also implies a shorter period of uncertainty in estimating
the objectsâ€™ next movement. Thus, sampling
duration increase has an effect on raising the sensing
operation cost and decreasing the prediction inaccuracy.
Figure 7: Impact of the sampling duration
The figure shows that ALL NBR heuristic, while
maintaining a very low missing rate, is not a good
choice for the OTSN when it takes more than 175msec
for each sampling. It implies that the operation cost
for the longer sampling period overwhelms the energy
saving obtained by accurate predictions.
