An appropriate cost metric must weight multiple parameters: (a)
communication overhead (b) query performance (c) error or signal
distortion from lossy compression (d) computation overhead (e)
storage cost . Combinations of the above parameters can be tuned
to specific sensor network deployments.
We have explored configurations that compress based primarily
on either communication cost or error. Bounding the communication
cost at each level of the hierarchy ensures that clusterheads do
not incur significantly higher communication overhead than other
nodes in the network. The compression error can, however, vary
depending on the spatio-temporal correlation in the data. For example,
an area with high correlation may be described with low
error within the specified communication bound, but a region with
low correlation would incur greater error. Conversely, bounding
the compression error would result in the compression adapting to
the correlation in different regions, but unbounded communication
overhead if the data is highly uncorrelated. We are exploring joint
optimization criteria that include both these parameters.
In a different scenario, a sensor network might consist of lowend,
highly resource constrained devices (such as motes [13]),
where computation, memory and storage are highly constrained, in
additional to energy. In these networks, the hierarchy can be constructed
by propagating approximation coefficients of the wavelet
transform, which is computationally less expensive than subband
coding.
