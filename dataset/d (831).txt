Due to space constraints, we will introduce only a flavor of techniques
that we are exploring in this area. As discussed above,
bounding the communication overhead at each level of the decomposition
can reduce the uneven distribution of energy consumption.
Additional load-balancing can be provided by periodically hashing
to a new apex location, implicitly changing the choice of clusterheads
at different levels.
A strictly hierarchical configuration (as described above) is vulnerable
to node failures, since loss of a node cuts off data from
any of its children. We are therefore exploring decentralized, peerbased
structures. One approach we are considering communicates
summarized data to all members of the next higher level, rather than
to just the clusterhead. Such an approach will have higher overall
energy consumption and will require greater data compression, but
it becomes immune to node failure and is naturally load balanced
since data is replicated equally to all nodes.
