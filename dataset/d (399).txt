In this paper we discuss the problem of monitoring data
sensed in large sensor networks. A sensor typically runs on
a battery having a limited lifetime. In order to increase the
lifetime of a sensor it is important that the mechanisms used
in monitoring them be energy-eAcient. In this paper, we
propose a new paradigm called Prediction-based monitoring
for energy-eAcient monitoring. We show that the paradigm
can be visualized as a watching of a \sensor movie" and
that concepts from MPEG may be applied to it. We have
implemented the proposed algorithms in a test bed of Rene
Motes [2]. Experimental results show that the proposed so-
lutions cut down the energy consumption by more than 5
times, considerably increasing sensor lifetimes, and thereby,
the lifetime of the networks formed from these sensors.
