4.2.1. Fault Resilience of the Spanning Tree
First, we consider a baseline routing topology in which
aggregates are computed across a single spanning tree.
For simplicity, we assume that we have a complete
d-ary tree of height h. In general, the probability of
a value from a node at level i to reach the root is
proportional to ()i. The expected value of the
COUNT aggregate is E(count) = Ph
where ni is the number of nodes at level i. This gives
us E(count) = . For
h = 10, d = 3 and p = 0:1 (a 10% link loss rate) the
expected fraction of the nodes that will be counted is
poor, only 0:369.
