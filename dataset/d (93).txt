Another way to improve resource selection is to refine the
queries instead of the profiles, e.g. by query expansion. As
is pointed out in [29], query expansion may help to overcome
problems due to the loss of document boundaries in profiles.
Two studies [29, 20] examine the effectiveness of query
expansion in DIR, reaching rather different conclusions: the
first study finds significant improvement over the baseline
CORI selection, the second one has discouraging results.
Query expansion is also used in some approaches to P2PIR:
in [8], a local pseudo feedback approach based on language
modeling is presented, first ranking peers w.r.t. the unexpanded
query and then using the best k results returned by
the top-ranked peer for pseudo feedback.
A final optimisation of resource selection concerns not so
much the query formulation process, but the overlap of documents
among information resources. This problem is addressed
in DIR by [24] and in P2PIR by [2], but not in the
experiments of section 5. However, it will be interesting to
investigate overlap more closely in future work.
