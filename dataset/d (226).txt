This experiment is aimed at determining the system performance when the listener is mobile. For a mobile listener, being able to obtain accurate location information within a short time is important. Figure 11 shows the con?guration of the beacons and the path followed by the mobile user while taking measurements. The listener was moved through each boundary at approximately the same speed each time, emulating a user’s typical walking speed in a building. Each time the listener crossed a boundary, a transition event and a timestamp was logged. Once through the boundary, the listener remained stationary for a short period of time to determine how long it takes to stabilize to the correct value, and then the experiment was repeated again through the next boundary. When analyzing the data, we used the logged transition event to determine the user’s actual location with respect to the location being reported by the listener. Note that in this experiment, the listener is always located relatively close to the boundaries.
Figure 12 shows the location error-rate at the listener for the experiment. The error-rate is calculated over the time period during which the listener moves around a location, after crossing a boundary. The MinMode performs the best among the three inference algorothmsFrom the results, it is evident that larger time intervals provide better results over smaller intervals, which is not surprising since a larger interval gives the algorithm more samples samples to work with. Another interesting point is that MinMean and MinMode both perform about the same over small time windows. As the time interval gets smaller the probability that a distance value sample containing only a single value per beacon increases. A small number of samples causes both the mean and the mode to be the roughly the same.
