Over the past year, I have also been working with the TinyOS [20] group at UC Berkeley on developing software
for their “mote” sensor platform to support query processing. My research in this regard has focused on the
following areas:
 Catalog Management for Sensor Networks: Sensors need a generic way to advertise themselves to other
sensors and sensor database systems if they are to be used in a heterogeneous, randomly deployed fashion.
I have designed a simple catalog layer which our query processor can use to locate and query TinyOS
motes.
 Aggregation in the Network: The most important class of queries over sensor networks are aggregates
– queries about the values of groups of sensors. Efficiently evaluating these queries without sending all
data-tuples back to a central processing system is a major goal of the TinyOS project. My work on Tiny
Aggregates (TAG), submitted to VLDB 2002 and published in a preliminary form in WMCSA 2002 [31],
discusses the design of a system for processing such queries.
Thus, the on-sensor portions of the query processor enable location and power efficient querying of motes; when
combined with the server-side query processor described above, most of the pieces of the sensor-query processor
are in place. Figure 1 shows an overview of these components and how they fit together – we will discuss the
additional components that are needed in Section 5 below.
The remainder of this proposal is divided as follows: the next section offers some details about Fjords,
sensor-proxies, and the CACQ system. Section 3 then presents details of the catalog and on-sensor aggregation
3
systems discussed above. This is followed by a discussion of related work in Section 4. Finally, a discussion
of additional research that will be incorporated into my Ph.D, with a particular focus on the work required to
combine the components described above into a system for sensor query processing is given in Section 5.
