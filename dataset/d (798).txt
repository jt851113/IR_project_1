Through a series of experiments, we have shown that
the interleaved algorithm is significantly better than the
sequential algorithm. The interleaved algorithm performs
at least as well, and often times, significantly better than the
sequential algorithm. Performance benefits range from 5%,
when support is very high, to several hundred percent, when
large itemset sizes are over 5. (Much of this overhead comes
from the increased I/O costs that the sequential algorithm
incurs.) Further, the interleaved algorithm scales nicely
with increasing data. Thus, one can conclusively say that
the interleaved algorithm and the pruning ideas behind it
provide significant gains in performance.
