In this section, we illustrate several important properties
of dominant skyline points. We first formally show that
lowering k will always result in smaller or equal number of
k-dominant skyline points.
Lemma 3.5. If pi k + 1-dominates pj, then pi must kdominate
pj .
From the last corollary, we can see that the set of dominant
skyline points decreases monotonically with the decrease
of the parameter k and thus we are sure that a sufficiently
small k can reduce the number of k-dominant skyline
to a manageable size for presentation to users. However,
one worries that too small a k value might find points which
do not make sense semantically to users. For example, if
k < d/2, this will mean that a point p can k-dominate another
point q even if it is only better in fewer than half
the dimensions. We alleviate this worry by showing that kdominant
skyline points for k < (d+2)/2 are in fact rather
easy to interpret.
Theorem 3.8. If k < (d + 2)/2, any pair of k-dominant
skyline points must have the same values on at least 
dimensions.
The last theorem tells us that when k is too small, either
1) there is only one k-dominant skyline point which has very
strong dominant power in that it dominates all the points on
many dimensions or 2) there are multiple k-dominant skyline
points which are equal on a number of dimensions and have
different relative ordering on the remaining dimensions.
We will next motivate the need to look for a top-Î´ dominant
skyline points. The following theorem shows that there
may not be any k-dominant skyline point in a data set for
any k < d.
Theorem 3.9. For any k < d (d > 2) and a d-dimensional
space S, there exists a data set D with size |D| > d such that
DSP(k, D, S) = ?.
Example 3.2 Fig. 2 shows an example data set that exhibits
the cyclic dominance relationship when k = 3. Specifically,
we have pi 3-dominates , and p4 in turn
3-dominates p1.
