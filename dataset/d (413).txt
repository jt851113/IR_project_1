Packet losses are quite common on wireless links. They are
especially common in sensor networks because of the prim-
itive channel encoding used. We briey look at their eect
on the sensors operating in PREMON paradigm.
When a prediction is lost on the wireless link, the sensor
continues to operate in default mode. The only eect of this
loss is that the sensor will end up transmitting its reading
even though it was expected/predicted at the base station.
A more interesting case occurs when updates are lost while a
prediction is active at a sensor. Suppose that a prediction is
active at a sensor and the sensor's reading does not match
with the predicted value. This would cause the sensor to
send an update to the base station. If this update is lost
on the wireless link, the base station would wrongly assume
that the sensor's reading conformed with the prediction |
a false positive. We believe that this problem is no worse
than the one caused by loss of updates (from sensors oper-
ating in default mode) on the wireless link, which causes the
base station to not know what is going on in the sensor eld.
Since it is quite common to have group of sensors in close
proximity in sensor networks, these problems caused by loss
of updates will be controlled by the inherent correlation in
their readings. As long as at least one of the updates of sen-
sors from a group monitoring the same phenomenon reaches
the base station, we will be able to eectively monitor the
sensor eld despite channel errors
