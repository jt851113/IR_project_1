Since timer-based queries are only periodically executed their
use can significantly reduce computation time and make the
system more scalable. Timer-based queries are grouped in the
same way as change-based queries except that the time
information needs to be recorded at installation time. Grouping
large number of timer-based queries poses two significant
challenges. First, it is hard to monitor the timer events of those
queries. Second, sharing the common computation becomes
difficult due to the various time intervals. For example, two
users may both request the query in Figure 3.1 with different
time intervals, e.g. weekly and monthly. The query with the
monthly interval should not repeat the weekly queryâ€™s work. In
general, queries with various time intervals should be able to
share the results that have already been produced.
