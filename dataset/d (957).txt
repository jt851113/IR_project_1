We now present two performance studies to motivate the
architecture given above. The first study, given in this section,
covers the performance of Fjords. The second study,
given in Section 5, examines the interaction of sensor power
consumption and the sensor proxy and demonstrates several
approaches to traffic sensor programs which can dramatically
alter sensor lifetime.
