Automated sensing is not new technology, but to date sensors have not been a big driver of database research. Looking at our spectrum of devices above, we see two trends that are bringing sensor-data support to the fore. The ?rst is the decreased cost and size of the actual sensing hardware. Prior generations of data-intensive sensors were
very expensive (as in the case of EOSDIS) and/or burdensome to use (as in the case of large dataloggers). As a result, these sensors were not widely deployed, and the interested customers at the time preferred to buy or write applicationspeci?c software. As sensors become much smaller and cheaper, they will be more widely used, and general-purpose off-the-shelf analysis software will become much important in this domain. The second, more sigini?cant trend is the convergence of sensing devices and networked computing in a single package. Once sensors are bundled with a processor and a radio, it becomes very easy to deploy large quantities of sensors that set up their own ad-hoc network infrastructure. These trends have led the database community to begin a number of research agendas related to the rise of sensor technology. We review them here, and place them in context of our sensor technology spectrum.
