We have conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our
Sort-Filtering method. We also compare the performance with all the algorithms
proposed by Chan et al. which are One-Scan Algorithm (OSA), Two-Scan Algorithm
(TSA) and Sorted Retrieval Algorithm (SRA) [6]. To make the comparison
fair, we have include all the preprocessing cost, i.e., cost of domination power
computation and sorting.
