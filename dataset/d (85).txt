I plan address each of the above research tasks in the next 6 - 9 months, with the goal of completing my thesis
in the Spring or Summer of 2003. The following timeline maps out the schedule of research:
 May - June, 2002: Complete sensor-side software with User-Defined Functions, Schema API, and Catalog
Server (with Wei Hong.)
 June 2002: Submit ICDE paper on streaming semantics (with Sirish Chandrasekaran).
 June - August, 2002: Integrate with Telegraph (or its successor), build sensor proxy with some initial set
of policies, deploy lab monitoring application, and collect data on usage patterns in the network (withWei
Hong, Intel Berkeley, and Telegraph research group.)
 August - November, 2002: Integrate with historical data interface of Telegraph. Assuming Telegraph
engine implementation goes as planned, this should be straightforward (with Telegraph research group.)
 November 2002: SIGMOD paper on real-world measurements from sensor-networks.
 August - January, 2003: Explore and implement mechanisms for handling resource constraints.
 February, 2003: VLDB paper on resource constraints.
 February - May 2003: Complete Dissertation.
