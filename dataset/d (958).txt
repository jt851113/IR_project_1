We present here two sample queries which we will refer
to through the rest of the section, as given by the following
SQL excerpts. These queries are representative of the
types of queries commuters might realistically ask of a traffic
inquiry system. These queries are run over data from 32
of CalTrans’ inductive loops collected by an older generation
of sensors equipped with wireless radio links that relay
data back to UC Berkeley. These sensors consist of sixteen
sets of two sensors (referred to as “upstream” and “downstream”),
with one pair on either side of the freeway on eight
distinct segments of I-80 near UC Berkeley. The sensors are
386-class devices with Ricochet 19.2 kilobit modem links
to the Internet. They collect data at 60Hz and relay it back
to a Berkeley server, where it is aggregated into counts of
cars and average speeds or distributed to various database
sources (such as ours) via JDBC updates.
Query 1 selects theaveragespeedover segments of the
road, using an average window interval of
seconds. These queries can be evaluated using just the streaming 
data currently arriving into the system.They require no additional
data sources or access to historical information.
Query 2 joins sensor readings from slow road segments
the user is interested in to traffic incidents which are
known to have recently occurred in the Bay Area. Slow
road segments are those with an average speed less than. The set 
of segments the user is interested in is.“Recently” means since

seconds before the current time. The California
Highway Patrol maintains a web site of reported incidents
all over California, which we can use to build the
incidents relation [4]. Evaluating this query requires a join
between historical and streaming data, and is considerably
more complicated to evaluate than Query 1.
