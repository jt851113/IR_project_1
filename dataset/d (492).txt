5.2.2 Multiple Supports Scheme Multiple supports scheme
was introduced by Liu et. al. [13] and later extended by Wang
et al. [25] to find itemsets which do not occur frequently overall,
but have high correlation to occur with some other items.
The support threshold to qualify a frequent itemset can be specified
as a fraction of the minimum support of all items [13] or
subsets of items [25] in the itemset. This variable support has
similar effect as the generalized information gain introduced in
this paper. However, there exists some fundamental difference
between these two concepts. For example, if the support of item
A, B, and C is 0.01, 0.02, 0.8, respectively, then the support
threshold to qualify itemset AB and AC is the same. Nevertheless,
the itemset AC is expected to occur more frequently than
AB because the support of C is much larger than that of B. This
aspect was not fully taken into account by the multiple support
model12. In contrast, the generalized information gain metric
would capture the difference of occurrences between B and C.
