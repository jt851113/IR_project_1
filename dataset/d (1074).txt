We consider k-dominant skyline query problem and present a Sort-Filtering
method.We demonstrate that our method is easy to compute and can be used for
high dimensional large datasets. Performance evaluations show the superiority
of the proposed method against the OSA, TSA and SRA algorithms.
k-Dominant skyline reduces the number of interesting objects returned by
skyline. But sometimes the number of k-dominant skyline objects can still be
large when k is not sufficiently small. If k is too small, no (or few) k-dominant
skyline objects are returned. Though our efficient computation allows us to compute
k-dominant objects for various k, proper guide for choosing the right value
of k is an open problem.
