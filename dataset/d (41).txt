Hardware for sensor nodes that combine physical
sensors, actuators, embedded processors,
and communication components has advanced
significantly over the last decade, and made
the large-scale deployment of such sensors a
reality. Applications range from monitoring
applications such as inventory maintenance
over health care to military applications.
In this paper, we evaluate the design of a
query layer for sensor networks. The query
layer accepts queries in a declarative language
that are then optimized to generate efficient
query execution plans with in-network processing
which can significantly reduce resource
requirements. We examine the main architectural
components of such a query layer, concentrating
on in-network aggregation, interaction
of in-network aggregation with the wireless
routing protocol, and distributed query
processing. Initial simulation experiments
with the ns-2 network simulator show the
tradeoffs of our system.
