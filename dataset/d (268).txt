We now give some analytical bounds on the energy costs and savings that can be obtained with data aggregation, based on the distances between the sources and the sink, and the inter-distances among the sources. The main point of this section is that the greatest gains due to data aggregation are obtained when the sources are close together and far away from the sink. Let di be the distance (in terms of number of hops) of the shortest path from source Si to the sink in the graph. Per datum, the total number of transmissions required for the optimal AC protocol in this case (call it NA) is:
Let the number of transmissions required for the optimal DC protocol be ND. De?nition : The “diameter” X of a set of nodes S in a graph G is the maximum of the pairwise shortest paths between these nodes X = maxi,j?SSP(i,j) where SP(i,j) is the shortest number of hops needed to go from node i to j in G. Result 2: If the source nodes S1,S2,...Sk have a diameter X ?1, the total number of transmissions (ND) required for the optimal DC protocol satis?es the following bounds: 
Corollary: If the diameter X < min(di), then ND < NA. In other words, the optimum data-centric protocol will perform strictly better than the AC protocol in terms of the total number of transmissions. Result 3: Assume X and k are ?xed, then as min(di) tends to in?nity (i.e. as the sink is farther and farther away from the sources):
