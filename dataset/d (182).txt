The contributions of this paper are four-fold: ?rst, we propose a simple, SQL-like declarative language for expressing aggregation queries over streaming sensor data and identify key properties of aggregationfunctions that affect the extentto which they can be ef?cientlyprocessed inside the network. Second, we demonstrate how such in network execution can yield an order of magnitude reduction in communication compared to centralized approaches. Third, we show that by adopting a well-de?ned, declarative query language as a level of abstraction between the user and speci?c networking and routing protocols, a number of optimizations can be transparently applied to further reduce the data demands on the system. Finally, we show that our focus on a high-level language leads to useful end-to-end techniques for reducing the effects of network loss on aggregate results.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we brie?y review the TinyOS hardware and software environment. Then, we discuss the syntax and semantics of queries in TAG and classify the types of aggregates supported by the system, focusing on the characteristics of aggregatesthat impact their performanceand fault tolerance. We then present the core TAG algorithm and show how our solution satis?es the query requirements while providing performance and tolerance to network faults. We discuss several optimizations for improving the performance of the basic approach. Additionally, we include experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms in a simulation environment, as well as a brief study of a real-world deployment on TinyOS motes. Finally, we discuss related work and conclude.
