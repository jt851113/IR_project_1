PROPOSITION 2.1. (Triangle Inequality) Given an event sequence
 and two complementary patterns 	 and 	  of the
same period, let  be the minimum common super pattern of
	 and 	 . Then the generalized information gain of  with
respect to  is at most the summation of that of 	 and 	 .
Proof. Since 	 and 	  are complementary, the information of
 is   	  	 and   	  	
for any event sequence . Then for any sequence , the
generalized information gain of  with respect to  is
because the support of  in  (i.e., ) is at most the
support of 	 in  (i.e., 	). Thus this proposition holds.
Proposition 2.1 can be easily generalized to a set of complementary
patterns, which is stated as follows.
