In this section, we evaluate our approach as well as two
comparative approaches, Naive approach and Eureka [10], in
the network simulator ns-2 [3]. The naive approach simply
disseminates the queries in a flooding way. We use it as a
baseline approach because it is simplest in maintenance yet
proved to be efficient in search though with obvious drawbacks.
We also compare our algorithm with Eureka because
the Eureka approach is the most recently proposed approach
related to our work and has been proved to be more effective
than several previous works. In the Eureka approach, each
node maintains information density evaluation of resources
in the surrounding range, within which it can reach other
nodes in multi-hops. This range is called a region. Queries
are propagated to a region that is evaluated to have higher
information density.
