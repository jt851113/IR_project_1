In order to perform the selection task, each entity – be
it a broker in DIR or a peer in P2PIR – needs to have a
description of the content offered by each of the available
information resources. Queries will be matched against these
profiles in order to make a selection decision.
In DIR, it is common to represent information resources
by so-called unigram language models, that is, the set of
terms (or a subset of these) that occur in the documents of
the resource, together with their document frequencies or
some similar statistics [7, 12]. The idea of most of these
approaches is to treat information resources as giant documents
and to use a retrieval function, identical or similar to
the ones used for documents, to rank these resources and
select the top-ranked ones.
In P2PIR, there is no such commonly accepted peer representation.
Although the representation of peers by unigram
language models is also used [19, 9], a number of alternatives
exist, including the use of categories from ontologies or
taxonomies to represent peers (e.g. [4]) or approaches that
have each peer record which other peers have (successfully)
answered which queries, resulting in “distributed” profiles
(see section 2.2 below).
The main reason for the emergence of these alternatives is
the need for compactness in P2PIR: peer profiles often need
to be sent around to other peers and stored in their routing
tables. Bandwidth and storage limitations present in P2P
settings make it necessary for profiles to be very compact.
