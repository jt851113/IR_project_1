If the look-ahead d = 0, the node x will not request for updates from other nodes. x will try
to resolve the query with the information it has, and will forward the query to a randomly
chosen neighbor. Thus, in this case, ACQUIRE reduces to a random walk on the network.
On an average it would take E(M) steps to resolve the query and E(M) steps to return
the resolved query back to the querier x. Thus,
