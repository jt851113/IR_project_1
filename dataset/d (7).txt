In this paper, we have presented energy-eAcient mechanisms
for performing monitoring operations in sensor networks.
For energy-efficient monitoring, we have proposed a new
paradigm called Prediction-based monitoring (PREMON).
It exploits the spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal corre-
lation likely to be present in readings of spatially proximate
sensors. We have shown that this paradigm is analogous in
many ways to the one followed by MPEG encoder. This
close analogy allows us to adapt the theory and algorithms
of MPEG for use in sensor networks. We have proposed
an algorithm for generating prediction models based on the
block-matching algorithm in MPEG. We have implemented
the proposed algorithm on a test bed of sensor-motes. The
results of our experiments have shown that utilizing the
PREMON paradigm helps in signicantly cutting down the
number of transmissions from the sensors, thereby achieving
substantial energy savings.
