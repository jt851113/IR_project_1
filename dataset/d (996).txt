We found that the algorithm as described above did not
work well in all cases. Obviously, if there are very few
edges in the neighborhood graph not much can be inferred
from the connectivity. We built a neighborhood
visualization tool which allowed us to trace the computation
and discover three other reasons why the algorithm
tends to fail:
1. Mutually Reinforcing Relationships Between Hosts:
Sometimes a set of documents on one host point to
a single document on a second host. This drives up
the hub scores of the documents on the rst host
and the authority score of the document on the second
host. The reverse case, where there is one document
on a rst host pointing to multiple documents
on a second host, creates the same problem. Since
we make the (simplifying) assumption that the set
of documents on each host was authored by a single
author or organization, these situations give undue
weight to the opinion of one \person."
2. Automatically Generated Links: Web documents
generated by tools (e.g., Web authoring tools, database
conversion tools) often have links that were
inserted by the tool. For example, the Hypernews
system which turns USENET News articles into
Web pages, automatically inserts a link to the Hypernews
Web site. In such cases Assumption ii,
namely that a human's opinion is represented by
the link, does not apply.
3. Non-relevant Nodes: We often nd that the neighborhood
graph contains documents not relevant
to the query topic. If these nodes are well connected,
the topic drift problem arises: the mosthighly
ranked authorities and hubs tend not to
be about the original topic. For example, when
running the algorithm on the query \jaguar and
car" the computation drifted to the general topic
\car" and returned the home pages of dierent car
manufacturers as top authorities, and lists of car
manufacturers as the best hubs.
