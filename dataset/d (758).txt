Given an n-ary relation, a subspace cluster is a local pattern (rather than cluster) of the
form (Xi )i=1..m where every Xi is a subset of a different attribute domain and m ? n.
It constrains the data restricted to every pair of elements to be strongly connected,
whereas an ET-n-set imposes one test per element (see Definition 5). Furthermore, in a
subspace cluster, every pair of elements (whatever the attribute domain(s) they belong
to) must frequently appear together in the relation and this frequency is defined w.r.t.
the whole relation. More precisely, a subspace cluster is claimed frequent if it exceeds
Î± times its expected value, which assumes a uniform distribution of the n-tuples in
the relation. CACTUS (Ganti et al. 1999) and Clicks (Zaki et al. 2007) extract maximal
(closedness constraint) subspace clusters from arbitrary n-ary relations. The latter
generalizes the former that only mines a restricted class of subspace clusters.
