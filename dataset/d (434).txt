Since there are a huge number of potential patterns, O(j=jLmax ),
a pruning method is needed to reduce the number of can-
didates. The pruning method is motivated by our observa-
tion that if a symbol d participates in some valid pattern
of period l, there should be at least min rep times that the
distance between two occurrences of d is exactly l (in order
to form a valid segment). So the proposed distance-based
pruning method makes one pass over the data sequence to
discover all possible periods and the set of symbols that are
likely to appear in some pattern of each possible period. For
each symbol d and period l, the number of times when the
distance between two occurrences of d in the sequence is l is
collected.

Our model not only allows partially specied patterns such
as (d; ; ) where d can also occur in the \*" position, but
also recognizes patterns with repetition of the same sym-
bol such as (d; ; d). Hence it is not sucient to just track
the distance of a symbol to its last occurrence. To perform
the distance-based pruning when scanning through the se-
quence, we need to maintain a moving window of the last
Lmax symbols scanned. For the next symbol, say d, we com-
pare it with each of the symbol in the moving window. If
a match occurs at the jth position, the count for period
(Lmax ?? j +1) of symbol d (denoted as Cd;Lmax??j+1) is
incremented by 1. For example, in Figure 1(a), the third
d1 in the sixth position will contribute to both Cd1;2 and
Cd1;5. Due to the generality of our model, for each occur-
rence of a symbol d we need to track its distance to all of
its previous occurrences within the moving window. Given
a symbol d and a period l, if Cd;l is larger than or equal
to the min rep threshold, then it is possible that d might
participate in some valid pattern of period l. We can use
this property to reduce the candidate patterns signicantly.
