Modern distributed information systems cope with disconnection
and limited bandwidth by using caches. In communicationconstrained
situations, traditional demand-driven approaches are
inadequate. Instead, caches must be preloaded in order to mitigate
the absence of connectivity or the paucity of bandwidth. In this paper,
we propose to use application-level knowledge expressed as
profiles to manage the contents of caches. We propose a simple,
but rich profile language that permits high-level expression of a
user’s data needs for the purpose of expressing desirable contents
of a cache. We consider techniques for prefetching a cache on the
basis of profiles expressed in our framework, both for basic and
preemptive prefetching, the latter referring to the case where staging
a cache can be interrupted at any point without prior warning.
We examine the effectiveness of three profile processing techniques,
and show that the rich expressivity of our profile language
does not prevent a fairly simple greedy algorithm from being an effective
processing technique. We also show that for a large shared
cache, multiple clients’ profiles can be combined into a single superprofile
that is representative of them all, but that when the number
of clients with profiles is significantly large, a randomized approach
is more scalable than a greedy approach. We believe that
profiles, as described in this paper, are an enabling technology
that could spawn a rich new area of research beyond cache management
into network data management in general.1
