The first scenario is one in which individuals within a
certain community share their own publications. We will use
the CiteSeer database. Authors are identified with peers, i.e.
a peer shares the documents that the corresponding person
has (co-)authored. A query log is used for extracting test
queries.
The collection was downloaded from the CiteSeer web
site2 on 17th November 2005 and contains – after removing
duplicates – 441,178 abstracts from which a total of
230,922 distinct author names was extracted and identified
with peers.
The distribution of the number of papers per author follows
a power-law, which means that the majority of peers
(149,421 = 64.7%) has only one or two documents. This distribution
is consistent with measurements of peer size distributions
in real P2P file-sharing networks [23].
The queries used in the experiments are taken from a portion
of the CiteSeer’s access logs, dating from August and
2http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/oai.html
September 2005. This portion contains 712,892 successive
queries, after deleting queries that were obviously generated
by bots. Among these queries, there are 367,110 distinct
ones, of which 122,082 occur more than once. Frequency of
queries follows another power-law, i.e. there are a few very
frequent queries and a vast majority of rare ones.
For the experiments, the last 10,000 queries of the log were
used to evaluate all strategies. The first 702,892 queries were
used as a training set in the evaluation of profile adaptation.
