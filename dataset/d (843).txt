Directed diffusion consists of several elements. Data is named
using attribute-value pairs. A sensing task (or a subtask
thereof) is disseminated throughout the sensor network as
an interest for named data. This dissemination sets up gradients
within the network designed to "draw" events (i.e.,
data matching the interest). Events start flowing towards
the originators of interests along multiple paths. The sensor
network reinforces one, or a small number of these paths.
Figure 1 illustrates these elements.
In this section, we describe these elements of diffusion with
specific reference to a particular kind of sensor network--
one that supports the task described in Section 2. Such a
network performs location tracking. As we shall see, several
design choices present themselves even in the context
of this specific instantiation of diffusion. We elaborate on
these design choices while describing the design of our sensor
network. Our initial evaluation (Section 4) focuses only
a subset of these design choices.
