The Floorplan is an active map navigation utility that uses Cricket and a map server to present a location-dependent “active” map to the user, highlighting her location on it as she moves. It also displays the set of services that are located in the vicinity of the user, which are dynamically updated as the user moves. Floorplan loads map images from the map server, which also provides the values of     coordinate on the map corresponding to the user’s current vspace position. As the user moves around the building, the listener infers its location and asks the map server to provide the location on the map. Floorplan also learns about various services in the vspace, and contacts those services and downloads a small icon representing each service. These icons are displayed on the map; when the user clicks on an icon, Floorplan uses INS to download a control script or program for the application represented by that icon, and load the controls into a new window so the user can control the application. Figure 13 shows an active map displayed by Floorplan; we see that the user (represented by the dot) is in room 503. It also displays four services it has found in the environment (space) :an MP3 service (represented by the speaker icon) in room 503, a TV service (represented by the TV icon) in room 504, and two printers (represented by the printer icons) in room 517. Using this, a user with no knowledge of her environment or software to control services within it can bootstrap herself with no manual con?guration.
