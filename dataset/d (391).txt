To observe the impact of moving behavior of tracked
objects on energy consumptions and missing rate of
PES scheme, we vary two important control parameters
for our simulation, the pause time and the average
speed of the moving objects. The pause time
controls the frequency a moving object changing its
state in terms of speed and direction, while the average

speed control an objectâ€™s possible moving range.
The average direction change, also controllable in our
simulation, is fixed to simplify our study.
A small pause time makes the moving pattern of
an object dynamic and thus difficult to predict. On
the other hand, a moving object with long pause time
keeps constant movement state longer and thus easier
to predict. Since the CM scheme significantly outperforms
the SM scheme when there is a limited number
of objects in the network, we use the total energy consumption
of CM as the watermark to compare the
PES scheme with various heuristics. In the remaining
experiments, we only include CM for comparison.
