B. Social Network Anonymization
  One major challenge in anonymizing a social network is that
changing labels of vertices and adding edges may affect the
neighborhoods of some other vertices as well as the properties
of the network. It has been well recognized that the following
two properties often hold in practical social networks. The
properties help us in designing anonymization methods.
Property 1: vertex degree in power law distribution. The
degrees of vertices in a large social network often follow the
power law distribution [20]. Such degree distributions have
been identified in various social networks including Internet,
biological networks, and co-authorship networks.
Property 2: the “small-world phenomenon” [11]. It is also
popularly known as “six degrees of separation”, which states
that large social networks in practice often have surprisingly
small average diameters.
  Our social network anonymization method processes vertices
in the degree descending order, and utilizes the above
two properties of large social networks in practice.
The k-anonymity requires that each vertex  is
grouped with at least (k - 1) other vertices such that their
anonymized neighborhoods are isomorphic. For a group S of
vertices having the isomorphic anonymized neighborhoods,
all vertices in S have the same degree. Since the degrees
of vertices in a large social network follow a power law
distribution, only a small number of vertices have a high
degree. Processing those vertices of high degrees first can
keep the information loss about those vertices low. There are
often many vertices of a low degree. It is relatively easy to
anonymize those low degree vertices and retain high quality.
Moreover, as will be shown soon, low degree vertices can be
used to anonymize those high degree vertices and do not affect
the diameters of the network too much.
