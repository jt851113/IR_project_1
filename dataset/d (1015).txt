In this paper, we consider k-dominant skyline query
problem and present a method for computing the query result
for a particular k at any time. By applying domination
power strategy, we reduce huge number of comparisons
between the k-dominant skyline objects and the dataset.
Our comprehensive performance study using real and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
is very efficient and scalable.
However, proposed method is efficient to compute k-
dominant skyline only for static datasets. It may not
be efficient for frequently updated datasets. The study
to facilitate incremental updates dataset is let for future
work.
