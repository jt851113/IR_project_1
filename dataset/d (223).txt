We conducted several experiments to investigate the performance of Cricket. The ?rst experiment examines the listener performance near location boundaries, and shows that we can achieve a location granularity of 4*4feet. The second experiment is aimed at investigating the robustness of the system to interference amongst beacons, and the evaluates the performance of the three location inference algorithms presented in Section 2.2.3 for static listeners. The third experiment examines the performance of the three decoding algorithms when a listener is mobile.
