This completes our discussion of the novel issues and techniques that arise when taking an acquisitional perspective on query processing. In summary, we ?rst discussed important aspects of an acqusitional query language, introducing event and lifetime clauses for controlling when and how often sampling occurs. We then discussed query optimization with the associated issues of modeling sampling costs and ordering of sampling operators. We showed how event-based queries can be rewritten as joins between streams of events and sensor samples. Once queries have been optimized, we demonstrated the use of semantic routing trees as a mechanism for ef?ciently disseminating queries and collecting results. Finally, we showed the importance of priortizing data according to quality and discussed the need for techniques to adapt the transmission and sampling rates of an ACQP system.
