The basic concept of DAB as described above applies to
multi-dimensional sensor graphs. Consider, for example, the
2D case. The input sensor graph would now be a weighted
mesh with sensors scattered around a 2D region. The draining
process is exactly the same as that in the 1D case. However, for
the balancing step, the “best” pair of adjacent trees to merge
would now be those whose sensors which are contained by the
smallest bounding square.
