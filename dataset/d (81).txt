Finally, there are some query-processor issues that are closely related to problems in sensor-query processing
that I have been exploring in conjunction with the Berkeley database group:
1. Historical Data Interface: The current Telegraph system does not provide a mechanism for logging and
querying historical sensor data, or for combining historical data with data currently streaming into the
system. Over this summer, I plan to work with the Telegraph research group to insure that the next
implementation of the Telegraph system includes support for logging and querying historical sensor data.
One possible approach for implementing such an interface is to use broadcast-disk [2] like data scheduling
to stream historical records needed by the current query workload when queries are blocked waiting for
additional current-time results to be delivered.
2. Query Model and Streaming Data Semantics: Sirish Chandrasekaran and I are currently working to enumerate
the space of query semantics over data streams. We hope to integrate this work into the Telegraph
query engine, which will provide a richly expressive tool for querying data flowing in from sensors.
