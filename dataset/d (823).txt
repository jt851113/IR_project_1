An important class of networked systems is emerging that involve
very large numbers of small, low-power, wireless devices. These
systems offer the ability to sense the environment densely, offering
unprecedented opportunities for many scientific disciplines to
observe the physical world. In this paper, we argue that a data
handling architecture for these devices should incorporate their extreme
resource constraints - energy, storage and processing - and
spatio-temporal interpretation of the physical world in the design,
cost model, and metrics of evaluation. We describe DIMENSIONS,
a system that provides a unified view of data handling in sensor networks,
incorporating long-term storage, multi-resolution data access
and spatio-temporal pattern mining.
