In building this system, we draw from significant research in information
theory [5, 6, 17], databases [7, 14], spatio-temporal data
mining [18, 19], and previous work in sensor networks [11, 20].
[14] and others have used wavelet-based synopsis data structures
for approximate querying of massive data sets. Quadtrees are popularly
used in image processing and databases [19], and resemble the
hierarchies that we build up. Other data structures such as R-trees,
kd-trees and their variants [18] are used for spatial feature indexing.
Triangular Irregular Networks (TIN [18]) is used in for multilayered
processing in cartography, and other geographical datasets.
Some of these structures could find applicability in our context, and
will be considered in future work. [11] proposes a sensor network
storage architecture that leverage the excellent lookup complexity
of distributed hash tables (DHT) for event storage. DHTs are useful
when queries are not spatio-temporal in nature, while our system
organizes data spatially to enable such queries.
