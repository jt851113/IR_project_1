In Figs. 11(a) and 11(b), we show several experimental
results on the NBA data set with equal weights on all attributes.
When varying the constraint parameter k, TSA
is the most efficient algorithm when k < 14, but is worst
among the three algorithms when k > 15. SRA is faster
than the other two when k is large. For top-δ dominant skyline
query, SRA is much more efficient than TSA because of
its great advantage over TSA on k-dominant skyline query
with large k.
In Table 3, we show the top-5 dominant skyline results on
NBA data set with three different weights assignments. The
first assignment is equal-weight assignment, i.e., all dimensions
are assigned the same weight. With the same weight on
all dimensions, we successfully find the superstars in NBA’s
history, such as Chamberlain and Jordan, listed in the first
column. In the second weight assignment, six attributes
related to defense, such as block, steal and rebound, are
given weights two times more than all other dimensions.
From the result of the defender biased weights in the second
column of the table, we can find famous defenders in
NBA. The third weight assignment concentrates on shooters,
which gives shooters’ strengths, such as points scored
and three pointers, two times more weight than other attributes.
Legendary shooters appear in the third column as
expected.
Since the NBA data set is fairly correlated, especially on
those attacking attributes, TSA is faster on shooter biased
weights than the other weights assignments in Fig. 11(c).
This shows that TSA is more sensitive to weight assignment
than the other two algorithms.
