Up to this point in our experiments we used a reliable environment where no messages were dropped and no nodes disconnected or went offiine. In this section, we address the problem of loss and its effect on the algorithms presented thus far. Unfortunately, unlike in traditional database systems, communication loss is a a fact of life in the sensor domain; the techniques described in the section seek to mitigate that loss.
