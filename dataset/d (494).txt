In this paper, we focus on mining partial periodic patterns
with random replacement. The generalized information gain
is used to seamlessly accommodate the different frequency of
event occurrences as well as gaps in an event sequence. The
triangle inequality preserved by the generalized information
gain enables us to devise a linear algorithm, STAMP, to mine the
significant pattern in any subsequence combinations. The OIS
pruning and MIG counting strategies also provide additional
performance improvement. The efficiency is demonstrated by
the experimental results.
