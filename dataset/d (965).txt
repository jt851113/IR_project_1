The dimension of a dataset has major impact on database
management, such as indexing and querying processing. The embedding
dimension (i.e., the number of attributes of the dataset) usually overestimates
the actual contribution of the attributes to the main characteristics of the
data, as the typical assumption of uniform distribution and independence
between attributes usually does not hold. In fact, due to dependencies and
attribute correlations, real data are typically skewed and exhibit intrinsic
dimensionality much lower than the embedding dimension. Similarly, the
intrinsic dimension can also be applied to improve data stream processing
and analysis. Data streams are generated as sequences of events represented
by a predetermined number of numerical attributes. Thus, without loss of
generality, we can consider events as elements from a dimensional domain.
This paper presents a fast, linear algorithm to measure the intrinsic dimension
of a data stream on the fly, following its continuously changing behavior.
Experimental studies show that the intrinsic dimension can be used to analyze
attribute correlations. The results on well-understood datasets closely follow
what is expected from the known behavior of the data.
