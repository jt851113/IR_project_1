We consider three profile-driven prefetching problems:
Non-Preemptive Prefetching, Preemptive Prefetching, and
Prefetching for Shared Caches. Non-preemptive prefetching
is standard prefetching where a cache is filled with a set
of objects that are likely to be accessed by a client. Preemptive
prefetching allows prefetching to be interrupted prior
to completion. This is relevant for data recharging, where
a client can “unplug” his device from a network connection
at any time without warning. For preemptive prefetching,
what matters is not only the cache’s final contents but
the order in which objects are placed in the cache, as objects
placed into the cache early are the most likely to be
present in a partially filled cache resulting from preemption.
Prefetching for shared caches requires reconciling multiple
(and potentially competing) client profiles to prefetch
a cache that best meets the needs of all clients.
