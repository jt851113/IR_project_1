As discussed in the previous section we identied three
problems with Kleinberg's algorithm. In this section we
address problem 1, mutually reinforcing relationships between
hosts. The next section addresses problems 2 and
3.
Mutually reinforcing relationships between hosts give
undue weight to the opinion of a single person. Ideally
we would like all the documents on a single host to have
the same inuence on the document they are connected
to as a single document would. To achieve this we give
fractional weights to edges in such cases:
If there are k edges from documents on a rst host
to a single document on a second host we give each edge
an authority weight of 1=k. This weight is used when
computing the authority score of the document on the
second host. If there are l edges from a single document
on a rst host to a set of documents on a second host,
we give each edge a hub weight of 1=l. Additionally, we
discard isolated nodes from the graph. This leads to the
following modied algorithm:
In the appendix we prove that the H and A vectors converge,
i.e., that the algorithm terminates.
This modied algorithm was eective in eliminating
the mutually reinforcing relationship problem in all the
cases where we had encountered it. In our evaluation we
call this improved algorithm, imp.
