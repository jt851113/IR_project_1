In this paper, we have addressed the keyword based information
retrieval problem in a popular and realistic filesharing
mobile peer-to-peer network. The proposed solution
takes the advantage of the powerful mobile facilities to
share resources and information which are of great benefit
to peopleâ€™s daily life and various business applications.
An intelligence-based information retrieval algorithm is proposed
to help nodes decide where to forward the query, by
mimicking different human behaviors in social networking.
It is a light-weight and energy efficient approach using an
Intelligence Accuracy (IA) mechanism to evaluate the distance
from the node to the resource. We conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach.
The results show that our approach is well adaptive
in highly dynamic mobile P2P network, and yields superior
efficiency and effectiveness.
