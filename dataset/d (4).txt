The constraints on the quality of the answer to a monitor-
ing query required by a user govern the amount of energy
savings that may be achieved. The quality of answer is con-
trolled by two parameters:
1. Error tolerance: Controls the amount by which the
received answer may deviate from its actual reading
2. Delay tolerance: Controls the interval from the time a
sensor's reading changes to the time it is received at
the user.
The more the error tolerance, the less precise the prediction-
models need to be, and hence, more is the potential for
saving energy. In the extreme case when the error tolerance
is innite, the sensors do not have to transmit anything.
Also, the more the delay tolerance, the more time is available
to generate prediction-models. This increases the potential
for generating close-to-perfect prediction models at the base
station, which, in turn, increases the potential for saving
energy.
