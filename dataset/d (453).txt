Definition 2.8 Given a pattern P with period and a se-
quence D of N events: the infor-
mation loss of D with respect to P is the summation of the
information loss of each segment 
with respect to P. The generalized information gain of D
with respect to P is defined as 
where are the information of P,
the support of P within D, and the information loss of D with
respect to P,respectively.

In a subsequence, the first match of a pattern is viewed as an
example, and only subsequent matches contribute to the generalized
information gain.
