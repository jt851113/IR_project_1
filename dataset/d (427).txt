The IBM Intranet traces consist of 160 critical nodes, e.g.,
file servers, routers, etc., in the IBM T. J. Watson Intranet.
Each node issues a message in response of certain situation,
e.g., CPU saturation, router interface down, etc. There are total 20 types of messages. We treat a certain message from
a particular node as a distinct event, thus there are total 500
distinct events in the trace because a certain type of node
may only send out 4 or 5 types of messages. The IBM Intranet
trace consists of 10,000 occurrences of the events. By
applying InfoMiner on this trace, we found some surprising
patterns that are also interesting. For example, the pattern
(nodea_fail,*, nodeb_saturated,*) has the eighth highest information
gain. This pattern means that a short time after a
router (node~) fails, the CPU on another node (nodeb) is saturated.
Under a thorough investigation, we found that nodeb
is a file server and after node~ fails, all requests to some files
are sent to nodeb, thus causes the bottleneck. Further experimental
results can be found in [14].
