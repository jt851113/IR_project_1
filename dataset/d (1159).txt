We expect that for a continuous query system over the Internet,
incremental group optimization will provide substantial
improvement to system performance and scalability. In the
following experiments, we compare our incremental grouping
approach with a non-grouping approach to show benefits from
sharing computation and avoiding unnecessary query
invocations.
