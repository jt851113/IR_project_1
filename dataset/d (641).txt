Research areas related to our work include sensor
databases, network aggregation, and quality-aware data
collection. Recent works in sensor databases, such as
the TinyDB project [16] and COUGAR project [23] investigate
various issues in developing a sensor database.
Madden et al. at UC Berkeley also investigated the implementation
of aggregation as part of the system service
architecture[17]. The work on quality aware sensor data
management that we are doing in our QUASAR project
[13] tries to trade data quality for network performance
in an efficient way.
In sensor network data gathering area, several approximate
network clustering algorithms using weaklyconnected
dominating sets were presented in [4]. [12]
and [5] target uniform energy dissipation to achieve maximum
lifetime for a sensor network. LEACH [7] and PEGASIS
[15] explore cluster-based data gathering protocols
that rotate the cluster-head randomly to evenly distribute
workload among sensor nodes. Directed Diffusion
[10] provides a data dissemination approach in which a
node requests data by propagating interests, in which aggregation
is implemented through “path sharing”. Aside
from aggregation, power-aware routing [21] techniques
have been recently developed to minimize the cost of intermediate
routing nodes in ad-hoc networks.
Research in quality-aware data collection addresses
the relation between quality requirements of query answers
and quality of the raw data, with the ultimate goal
of satisfying query requirements while minimizing certain
cost. For example, Lazaridis et al.[14] developed an
approximate data compression algorithm for data archiving.
Our previous work [25] interprets quality of spatial
range query results using probabilistic uncertainty. Olston
et al.[19] provided an adaptive data collection protocol
to collect data with certain precision requirements
so that the application quality requirements of continuous
queries can be met and the total communication cost
for collecting the data is minimized. Constrained data
caching [18, 1] deals with how to ensure consistency constraints
dynamically in distributed databases. Our error
bound adjustment method bears similarity to the works
in this area to some extent.
Most of the previous works have ignored the underlying
physical network that carries the data collection messages.
Our approach takes this into consideration and exploits
the hierarchical structure of networks to enforce
group quality for each cluster. To the extent of authors’
knowledge, we are not aware of any previouswork on approximate
data aggregation based on a hierarchical structure
which enforces group quality constraints. Given the
importance of sensor monitoring applications, we believe
this is a critical issue that can impact performance in a variety
of sensor application domains.
