In this paper, we have studied the problem of discovering
association rules that display regular cyclic variation
over time. Information about such variations will allow
marketers to better identify trends in association rules and
help better forecasting. By exploiting the relationship between
cycles and large itemsets, we identified optimization
techniques that allow us to minimize the amount of
wasted work performed during the data mining process.
We demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques through
an extensive experimental study. The study showed that
performance benefits ranging from 5% to several hundred
percent can be obtained through the use of the optimizations
when compared to the more straightforward approach.
Recently, we have explored, in [RMS97], the integration
of calendars into an association rule mining framework.
This lets us consider rules like, “

, the first working
day of every month.” In [RMS97], we also address the
problem of approximate matching, which relaxes the rather
rigid definition of when a cycle belongs to an association
rule. Interesting open problems include the handling of
multiple time units (like hours, weeks, days, etc.) simultaneously
and efficiently, integrating cycles and calendars
into the numeric, rather than the boolean domain handled
by the association rules in this paper.
