To optimize a query, Garlic uses a set of STrategy Alternative
Rules, or STARs [Loh88], which construct plans that
can be handled by Garlic’s query engine. Garlic’s enumerator
fires appropriate STARs, following a dynamic programming
model, to build plans for the query bottom-up. Garlic
differs from [Loh88] in that some of Garlic’s STARs are
generic. These STARs are fired during enumeration when
a piece of work is found that can or must be done by a
wrapper. Generic STARs consult the appropriate wrapper
to build their piece of the plan. From the resulting set of
complete plans for the query, the optimizer selects the winning
plan based on cost. This plan will then be translated
into an executable (or interpretable) format.
