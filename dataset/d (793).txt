We now present the results of an extensive set of experiments
conducted to analyze the behaviour of the sequential
and interleaved algorithms. In these experiments, it should
be kept in mind that the sequential algorithm had an inherent
advantage in considering the time segments of the
data one by one. All but the largest time segments that we
used fit entirely in the main memory of the machine that we
used. The interleaved algorithm which sweeps repeatedly
through the entire data incurs more I/Oâ€™s.
