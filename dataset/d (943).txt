2.1.2. Next-Generation Traffic Sensors. Current research
on sensor devices is focused on producing very small sensors
that can be deployed in harsh environments (e.g. the
surface of a freeway.) Current sensor prototypes at UC
Berkeley, MIT, and UCLA share similar properties: they
are very small, wireless radio-driven, and battery powered,
with a size of about 10 cm. The ultimate goal is to produce
devices in the 1 mm range – about the size of a gnat [15].
We refer to such miniscule sensors as “motes”. Current
prototypes use 8bit microprocessors with small amounts of
RAM (less than 32kBytes) running from 1 to 16 MHz, with
a small radio capable of transmitting at tens of kilobits per
second with a range of a few hundred feet[12]. As sensors
become miniaturized, they will be small enough that they
could be scattered over the freeway such that they will not
interfere with cars running over them, or could fit easily
between the grooves in the roadway. Sensors could be connected
to existing inductive loops, or be augmented with
light or pressure sensors that could detect whenever a car
passed over them.
One key component of this new generation of sensors is
that they are capable of on board computation, which may
take the form of simple filtering or aggregation. This ability
allows the computational burden on the server and the
communications burden on the motes to be reduced. For example,
rather than directly transmitting the voltage reading
from a light sensor many times a second, motes could transmit
a count of the number of cars which have passed over
them during some time interval. This aggregation reduces
the amount of communication required and saves work at
the central server. In an environment with tens of thousands
of sensors, the benefits of such reductions can be substantial.
