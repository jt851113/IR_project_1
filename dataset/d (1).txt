We show the computation of energy consumption at sensor
with address 4. The energy consumption at other sensor-
motes can be similarly computed.
Total Energy consumed (TE4) = Energy consumed in trans-
mitting updates + Energy consumed in receiving predictions
The base-station makes 60 movement predictions. In the
absence of these, there will roughly be 60 instances where
an object will pass by this sensor (assuming, for simplicity,
that predictions were correct). In each of these instances,
the sensor will generate 3 updates { one update is gener-
ated when it detects a change in reading. The other two are
generated because base-station mote does not make a con-
stant value prediction until it has seen two consecutive sets
of constant readings. Thus, the sensor will see 141 (81+60)
constant value predictions and it will save 415 (595 - 60x3)
transmissions of updates.

Thus,
TES4 = [1800 - (972 + 415)]  Tu + 141  Rcp
= 39.16 mJ
Following similar approach, the total energy consumed at

sensors with addresses 8, 12, and 14 is given by:
TES8 = 411  Tu + 143  Rcp = 39.02 mJ
TES12 = 435  Tu + 140  Rcp = 41.08 mJ
TES14 = 396  Tu + 130  Rcp = 37.40 mJ
The total energy consumed at base-station mote in receiving
updates and sending predictions is given by:
TEb = (413+411+435+396)  Ru +
(141+143+140+130)  Tcp
= 94.98 mJ
We assume that the cost of generating each constant-value
prediction is negligible.
The total energy consumed in the system is given by:
TE2 = 39.16 + 39.02 + 41.08 + 37.40 + 94.98 = 251.64 mJ
