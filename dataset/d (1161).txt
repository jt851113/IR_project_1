The parameters in our experiments are:
1. N, the number of installed queries, is an important measure
of system scalability.
2. F, the number of fired queries in the grouping case. The
number of fired queries may vary depending on triggering
conditions in the grouping case. For example, in a Tye-1 query,
if Intel stock does not change, queries defined on “INTC” are
not scheduled for execution after the common computation of
the group. This parameter does not affect non-grouping queries.
3. C, the number of tuples modified.
In our grouping approach, a user-defined query consists of
grouped part and non-grouped part. Tg and Tng represent the
execution time of each part. The execution time T for evaluating
N queries is the sum of Tg and Tng of each of F fired queries,  
because the grouped portion is executed
only once.Since the non-grouping strategy needs to scan each XML data
source file multiple times, we cache parsed XML files in
memory so that both approaches scan and parse XML files only
once. This ensures that the comparison between the two
approaches is fair. However, in a production system, parsed
XML files probably could not be retained in memory for long
periods of time. Thus, many non-grouped queries may each have
to scan and parse the same XML files multiple times.
