In this section, we provide a brief overview of recent advances
that is closely related to our work presented in this
paper. There is much work in mining periodic patterns[4,
7, 13]. Despite the difference in problem formulation, most
work adopted the support as the measure of interestingness
(or significance) and aimed at discovering frequent patterns.
Recently, many efforts have been carried out to address the potential
disadvantages associated with the support model and
to propose alternative solutions. Due to space limitations, we
are focusing on the related work of models of interestingness.
Multiple supports scheme was introduced by Liu et. al. [6]
and later extended by Wang et al. [12] to find itemsets which
do not occur frequently overall, but have high correlation to
occur with some other items. The support threshold to qualify
a frequent itemset can be specified as a fraction of the minimum
support of all items [6] or subsets of items [12] in the
itemset. This variable support has similar effect as the information
gain introduced in this paper. However, there exists
some fundamental difference between these two concepts. For
example, if the support of item A, B, and C is 0.01, 0.02, 0.8,
respectively, then the support threshold to qualify itemset AB
and AC is the same. Nevertheless, the itemset AC is expected
to occur more frequently than AB because the support of C
is much larger than that of B. This aspect was not fully taken
into account by the multiple support model. In contrast, the
information gain metric proposed in this paper would capture
the difference of occurrences between B and C.
Mining patterns that are statistically significant (rather than
frequent) becomes a popular topic. Brin et al. [3] first introduced
the concept of correlation and it was shown that in many
applications the correlation measurement can reveal some very
important patterns. The Chi-squared test was used to test the
correlation among items. Instead of explicitly enumerating all
correlated itemsets, the border comprising the set of minimal
correlated itemsets 1 is identified, and no further distinction is
made on the degree of correlation of itemsets above the border
(i.e., supersets of some itemset on the border). This model
sometimes becomes sub-optimal. As shown in Figure 1, itemsets
A and B are highly correlated but C is independent of
them 2. In addition, {A, B, C, D} is also highly correlated. We
can view that the degree of correlation of {A, B, C} is not as
strong as that of {A, B} and {A, B, C, D}. This observation
can also be confirmed by the Chi-squared test a. In many applications,
users are only interested in the itemsets such as {A, B}
and {A, B, C, D}, but not {A, B, C}. However, [3] cannot distinguish
between {A, B, C} and {A, B, C, D} once {A, B} is
identified as a correlated itemset. Another potential drawback
of this model is the expensive computation required by
this model. The running time of all patterns with/-correlated
items is O(n x ICAND I x rain{n, 2i}) where n and ]CANDI
are the number of transactions and the number of candidates
at ith level, respectively. To overcome these drawbacks, Oates
et al. [9] proposed models for statistical dependencies using
G statistic and devised randomized algorithms to produce approximate
results. In contrast, our model not only can successfully
identify {A, B} and {A, B, C, D} without including
{A, B, C} but also leads to a much more efficient deterministic
algorithm.
Another important advance is accomplished in mining socalled
unexpected patterns. Berger et al. [1] proposed a probabilistic
measure of interestingness based on unexpectedness
1A minimal correlated itemset is a correlated itemset whose
subsets are all independent.
2Prob(AB) x Prob(C) = ~1 x g2 = Prob(ABC).
3In general, the chi-squared test requires a large sample. For
the demonstration purpose only, we assume that the chisquared
test is valid in this example.
in the context of temporal logic, whereby a pattern is deemed
interesting if the ratio of the actual number of occurrences
of the pattern exceeds the expected one by some user defined
threshold. Solving the problem in its general frame is in nature
NP-hard and hence some heuristics are proposed to produce
an approximate answer. Our model presented in this paper
can in fact achieve a similar objective but enables an efficient
solution without sacrificing the accuracy.
