We now briey survey the related work of our meth-
ods. Sensors and their limitations are described in Sec-
tion 2.1. Previous frameworks for processing aggregates
are covered in 2.2, and multipath routing techniques
are covered in 2.3. Finally, the sketches which we use
to improve upon these frameworks are introduced in
Section 2.4.
