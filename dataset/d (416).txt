Figure 7: A motion-sensor assembly

We create a motion-sensor for our experiments by using a
Mote tted with a light sensor (we refer to this assembly as
sensor-mote) and a focused light source. The sensor-mote is
placed in a small box in such a manner that light from the
pin-hole falls directly on the light sensor. The light source
is placed at a distance from the box, with its light falling on
the pin-hole (Fig 7).

In order to be able to detect rapid events, the sensor-mote
samples the light sensor 8 times per second. However, in
order to make efficient use of the channel bandwidth, the
sensor-mote transmits the light sensor readings only once
per second. Each transmission contains the eight most re-
cent readings of the light sensor.

When no activity occurs, the light sensor reads the maxi-
mum value. When an object passes between the light source
and the box containing sensor-mote, thereby obstructing the
light path, the readings of the light sensor changes. Fig 8
shows the typical uctuation in light sensor readings as an
object crosses the light path. These uctuations are re-
ported the next time the Mote transmits. The next set of
readings transmitted by the Mote will report these changes
in the light readings.
