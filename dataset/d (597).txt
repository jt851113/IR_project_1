We propose to group the documents in Di into Ki disjoint groups
Gij, j = 1, …, Ki such that EGij = Di, and Gij C Gik = A, where j 1
k. The value of Ki (1 ￡ Ki ￡ Ni) is independently identified for
each peer Pi based on its local shared content Di and the query
workload Q. The term set of a group Gij is defined as T(Gij) =
ET(dik), where dik I Gij. Each group can be considered as one
“super-document,” and thus the local posting list of a term t is
defined as li(t) = {<Gij, Pi>? tIT(Gij)}.
Our grouping technique is designed to minimize the following
cost
where Qi is defined as the set of queries that are erroneously
issued to peer Pi :
Clearly, the total cost C(Q), as defined in (1), is proportional to
the sum of Ci(Q) over all peers.
The first term of Ci(Q) is the cost of indexing local content.
Notice that the posting list of a term t may contain a maximum of
Ki postings. Thus, reducing Ki reduces the indexing cost. The
second term of Ci(Q) is the cost that Pi contributes to the total cost
of retrieving posting lists for queries in Q. Notice that this cost is
not directly related to Pi, but to peers responsible for terms in
VQ C Vi . The longer Pi’s local posting list for term t, the longer
the global posting list of term t, and the higher the posting list
retrieval cost imposed on the peer responsible for t, resp(t). By
optimizing this cost, Pi reduces cost of retrieving its posting lists.
Other peers, likewise, help Pi reduce its cost of maintaining the
global posting lists assigned to it. The last term of Ci(Q) is the
cost of erroneously issuing queries to Pi . We do not include the
cost of correctly issued queries, as this cost is the same for all
indexing strategies, and is unavoidable. Reducing Ki, however,
increases query issuing cost, since it increases the number of
erroneously issued queries.
