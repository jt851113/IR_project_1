In this section, we validate our analytical models by conducting some high level simulations.
Specifically, our objectives were the following:
1. Validate the effect of c on ACQUIRE.
2. Validate the comparisons between ACQUIRE, ERS and FBQ for different values of c.
Figure 8: Comparison of ACQUIRE, and ERS (N = 100) with respect to M
N for different
amortization factors.
3. Perform a relative comparison between ACQUIRE and ERS across different relative
query sizes (M
N ).
As we shall show, our simulation results are more or less in line with our analysis. The minor
differences can be ascribed to factors such as overlap in the query trajectory and boundary
effects that are not modelled in our analysis.
