The relevance weight of a node equals the similarity of its
document to the query topic. We describe next how to
compute the similarity score of a document D. As mentioned
before, the query topic is broader than the query
itself. Thus matching the query against the document is
usually not sucient. Instead we use the documents in
the start set to dene a broader query and match every
document in the graph against this query. Specically,
we consider the concatenation of the rst 1000 words
from each document to be the query, Q and compute
similarity(Q;D).
In our implementation, since queries are long and the
document vocabulary tends to be varied we use term
frequency weighting. We use cosine normalization in
weighting both the query and the documents since the
deviation in term vector lengths is large. See Salton and
Buckley [28] for a discussion of weighting options. Specifically,
