In order to provide visualization capability, we determine
the spatial profiles at a specific set of grid points. Let Xg be
such a grid point. Then, the value of vieXg; tT is calculated
using the perturbed velocity densities along the ith
dimension. Therefore, for each grid point, we maintain an
additional d perturbed values, one for each dimension.
Specifically, for a grid point Xg, the ith perturbed value is
the velocity density at the point Xg t i. Thus, during the
online scan of the data, we need to maintain an additional
d counters for each grid point at which these densities are
stored. At the end of the scan, the spatial profiles can be
computed by calculating each of the d components of the
spatial velocity as illustrated in (8). Note that this extra
effort at the end of the velocity density calculation is
(asymptotically) small for a rapid data stream, since it is
independent of the number of records in the stream. The
actual value of the perturbation  should be chosen as small
as possible subject to the numerical rounding errors created
by choosing  near the computer numerical precision. For a
practical implementation, we consistently chose  to be
1 percent of the distance between two adjacent grid points.
