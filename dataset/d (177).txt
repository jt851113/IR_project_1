Information retrieval over P2P distributed systems is important and challenging. Due to the large volume of data, syntax-based queries (e.g., keywords) usually return data that are irrelevant to user needs. By adding semantic information in queries, search experience may be improved, as demonstrated by semantic search in Web information retrieval. To capture the semantic relationship between queries and peer interests, we explore a novel idea that employs a Web ontology to model the semantics of both peer interests and queries, and develop a purely decentralized hierarchical overlay network to categorize peers based on the similarity of their interests. Through rigorous analysis and simulation experiments, we show that our approach provides a better solution for information retrieval in large-scale P2P networks.
