The basic idea of profile refinement is to characterise a
peer or information resource not only by the content that
it offers, but by the queries for which it provides relevant
documents.
Work on query-adapted profiles is rare in DIR, some related
ideas can be found in early work on collection fusion
[25] and adaptive resource selection [13].
In P2PIR, on the other hand, many systems use what
could be called a collective discovery approach by having
every peer in the system store query-related information associated
with other peers. The entirety of routing table entries
pointing to a peer can be viewed as its profile, shared
throughout the community.
Collective discovery approaches either store keywords from
queries [14, 1] or full queries [15, 16] in routing tables, together
with the addresses of peers that provided the answer.
Social metaphors are the basis for building profiles in [17].
An explicit learning approach is introduced in [1] and a semisupervised
learning approach is described in [21].
