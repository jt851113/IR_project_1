There are many algorithms that have been developed for tracking over time using a continuous set of noisy measurements. The classic reference [6] applies the standard Kalman filtering algorithm to the tracking of objects with a linear model. The algorithm receives continual measurements at fixed time intervals from the sensor (in radar tracking for example). In the domain, measurements are only available when the objects pass the nodes, and more importantly the measurements themselves are only available at the nodes. Despite the asynchronous measurement intervals, the Kalman filtering approach is very appealing due to its sequential convergence properties and the ‘prediction step’ that provides a means for associating new measurements.
As an object passes through the network, it will produce a set of events E=[e1, e2,……..,en]. Each event ei provides a time ti and the node position z(ti). The position is related to the underlying object state at the time of the event by means of the following equation:

Here the vector z(ti) only measures position, not velocity, and is given by the known position of the node. The additive noise vector v(ti) represents the uncertainty both in the known node position and in the position of the object within the sensing radius of the node. The variance caused by the non-zero sensing radius can be modeled by S/3 (assumption), and the variance of the node position by σk. Hence we get:
Assuming all the events are caused by the same underlying object, the conditional probability distribution of the state variables is a multivariate normal distribution given by the Kalman filter [10]. The mean x and variance P evolve between detections according to the following “time-update” equations:
At every new event, the conditional meanand covariancex?P? are given by the following “measurement update” equations:
As a data association criterion, the conditional probability distribution of the state variables provided by (5) may be used to validate any new event. The new event is associated if it falls within a certain n-sigma of the time-updated state distributions. The measurements can only be viewed at sporadic time intervals, depending on when the object passes a node. This means Θ and Q must be scaled according to the time interval between two sequential events. While R gives the initial position covariance, the initial velocity distribution should be dependant upon the range of velocities of the object to be detected. It is assumed the variance is given by a third of the maximum velocity of the objects to be tracked, Vmax/3, and the mean is zero.
