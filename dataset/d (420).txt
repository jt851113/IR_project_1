In this mode, the energy consumption at each sensor-mote
is easy to compute. Since the experiment runs for 30 mins,
each sensor will send 1800 (30x60) updates (at the rate of
once/sec) during the experiment. Therefore, the energy con-
sumed at each sensor-mote during the entire run of the ex-
periment is given by:
8Table 1 also assigns a symbol for each of the basic opera-
tion. We use these symbols in the rest of the paper.

consumption in cases#2 and case#3 relative to that

Es = 1800 (updates)  Tu = 158.4 mJ
The base-station mote in this mode receives 1800 updates
from each sensor during the entire run of the experiment.
Therefore, the energy consumed at the base-station mote is
given by:
Eb = 4  1800  Ru = 316.8 mJ
The total energy consumed in the system is given by:
TE1 = 158.4  4 +316.8 = 950.4 mJ
