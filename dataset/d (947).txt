2.2.3. Processing Multiple Queries. Sensors pose additional
difficulties when processing complex or concurrent
queries. In many sensor scenarios, multiple users pose similar
queries over the same data streams. In the traffic scenario,
for example, commuters will want to know about
road conditions on the same sections of road, and so will
issue queries against the same sensors. Since streams are
append-only, there is no reason that a particular sensor reading
should not be shared across many queries. As our experiments
in Section 4.3 show, this sharing greatly improves
the ability of a sensor query system to handle many simultaneous
queries.
Furthermore, the demands placed on individual sensors
vary based on time of day, current traffic conditions, and
user requirements. At any particular time users are very
interested in some sensors, and not at all interested in others.
A query processing system should be able to account
for this by dynamically turning down the sample and data
delivery rates for infrequently queried sensors.
