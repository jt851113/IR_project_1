We also ran several experiments to measure the performance of grouping in TAG, focusing on the behavior of various eviction techniques. We tried a number of simple eviction policies, but found that the choice of policy made little difference for any of the sensor-value distributions we tested â€“ in the most extreme case, the difference between the best and worst case eviction policy accounted for less than 10% of the total messages. Due to the relative insignificance of these results and space limitations,
we omit a detailed discussion of the merits of variouseviction policies.
