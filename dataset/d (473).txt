DEFINITION 2.8. For any two patterns 	        
and 	   
 
     
 of the same period , 	 and 	  are
complementary if either    or 
   for all     .
A set of patterns of the same period are said to be complementary
if every pair of patterns in the set are complementary.
DEFINITION 2.9. Given a set  of complementary patterns
of the same period , the minimum common superpattern
(MCSP) of  is the pattern 	 of period , which satisfies the
following two conditions.
	 Each pattern in  is a subpattern of 	.
	 There does not exist a subpattern 	  of 	 	  	 such
that each pattern in  is also a subpattern of 	 .
It follows from the definition that the information of the
MCSP of a set, , of complementary patterns is the summation
of the information of each pattern in . For example,
    ,     , and      are complementary
and their MCSP is     . The information
of      is        which
is exactly the summation of the informations of     ,
    , and     . For a given event segment
         and a set, , of complementary patterns,
the information loss of  with respect to the MCSP of  satisfies
the following equality

where 	 is the information loss of  with respect to 	.
The rationale is that if  is not in compliance with a pattern
in  on position , then the th position must be instantiated and
 must not be in compliance with the MCSP of  on position
 either. For instance, the information loss of the segment
     with respect to      is  
, which is equal to the aggregate of information loss of
that segment with respect to     ,     , and
    . In general, for any event sequence, the overall
information loss of  with respect to the MCSP of a set of
complementary patterns  is equal to the summation of the
information loss of  with respect to each pattern in .
