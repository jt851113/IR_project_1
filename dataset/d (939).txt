If industry visionaries are correct, our lives will soon be
full of sensors, connected together in loose conglomerations
via wireless networks, each monitoring and collecting data
about the environment at large. These sensors behave very
differently from traditional database sources: they have intermittent
connectivity, are limited by severe power constraints,
and typically sample periodically and push immediately,
keeping no record of historical information. These
limitations make traditional database systems inappropriate
for queries over sensors. We present the Fjords architecture
for managing multiple queries over many sensors,
and show how it can be used to limit sensor resource demands
while maintaining high query throughput. We evaluate
our architecture using traces from a network of traffic
sensors deployed on Interstate 80 near Berkeley and present
performance results that show how query throughput, communication
costs, and power consumption are necessarily
coupled in sensor environments.
