In this section, we report on some results from a preliminary simulation. We use a packet-level simulation to explore(in some detail) the implications of some of our design choices. This section describes our methodology, compares the performance of the greedy aggregation against the opportunistic aggregation, then explores impact of network dynamics and other factors on simulation.
