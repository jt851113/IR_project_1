Figure 6 shows the running time of the interleaved algorithm
as the time segment size is increased from 10?? transactions to 100?? transactions. (The database size increased
from 155MBto 1.5 GB.) The interleaved algorithm
shows nearly linear scaleup. This illustrates its ability to
handle large database sizes gracefully.
