2.1.1. Traffic Sensor Testbed. We have recently begun
working with the Berkeley Highway Lab (BHL), which, in
conjunction with the California Department of Transportation
(CalTrans), is deploying a sensor infrastructure on Bay
Area freeways to monitor traffic conditions. The query processing
system we present is being built to support this infrastructure.
Thus, in this paper, we will use traffic scenarios
to motivate many of our examples and design decisions.
CalTrans has embedded thousands primitive sensors on
Bay Area highways over the past few decades. These sensors
consist of inductive loops that register whenever a vehicle
passes over them, and can be used to determine aggregate
flow and volume information on a stretch of road as
well as provide gross estimates of vehicle speed and length.
Typically these loops are used to monitor specific portions
of the highway by placing data collection hardware at sites
of interest. With several thousand sensors streaming data,
efficient techniques for executing queries over those streams
are crucial.
