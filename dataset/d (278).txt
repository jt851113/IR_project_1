Another traditional application of sensor technology is traf?c sensing. In California, the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has instrumented freeways with approximately ten-thousand inductive loop sensors. These sensors consist of metal loops that are cut into the freeway and have a small current induced in them when a vehicle passes overhead. These loops are connected to a loop controller, such as the CalTrans Model 170 Controller [25] in a large metal cabinet on the side of the freeway, which aggregates data into vehicle counts and speeds and relays data back to a central server via a modem or wireless link. The Washington State Department of Transportation website [49] illustrates the design of a sensing system at a single freeway interchange. There continues to be a large amount of research associated with these sensors in the traf?c, civil, and electrical engineering communities; see, for example, [35, 42, 48]. This research, for the most part, appears to focus on two major areas: improving the resolving ability and quality of the sensors themselves, or doing more sophisticated of?ine analysis
of collected sensor data. The complexity of the collected data is low: each loop produces records with identical schemas, and on-freeway aggregation limits the rate at which it is produced. Furthermore, the infrastructure to load these records into traditional database and data analysis packages has been long established, making innovation dif?cult of little perceived utility.
