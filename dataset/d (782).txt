Given a set of items and a set of transactions, where
each transaction consists of a subset of the set of items, the
problem of discovering association rules is defined as finding
relationships between the occurrences of items within
transactions. An association rule of the form
  
is a
relationship between the two disjoint itemsets

and

(an
itemset is a set of items). An association rule is described in
terms of support and confidence. The support of an itemset

is the fraction of transactions that contain the itemset.
An itemset is called large, if its supports exceeds a given
threshold
	  	
. The confidence of a rule
  
is the
fraction of transactions containing

that also contain

the transaction model by a time attribute that describes the
time when the transaction was executed. In this paper, we
assume that a unit of time is given (e.g., by the user). More
complicated treatments of time, such as multiple units of
time and/or a time hierarchy, are not in the scope of this
paper. We denote the   time unit,  
 We define the problem of discovering cyclic
association rules as finding cyclic relationships between the
presence of items within transactions.
The support of an itemset in is the fraction of
transactions in that contain the itemset, whereas the
confidence of a rule in is the fraction of transactions
in containing that also contain An association rule

. A cycle

is a tuple  
consisting
of a length

(in multiples of the time unit) and an offset

(the first time unit in which the cycle occurs), 0
We say that an association rule has a cycle 
     
if the
association rule holds in every

  time unit starting with
time unit 
For example, if the unit of time is an hour and
‚Äúcoffee

doughnuts‚Äù holds during the interval7AM-8AM
every day (i.e., every 24 hours), then ‚Äúcoffee

doughnuts‚Äù
has a cycle 24 
We denote the minimum and maximum
cycle lengths of interest by and, respectively. We
refer to an association rule that has a cycle as cyclic. An
association rule may have multiple cycles. For example,
if the unit of time is an hour and ‚Äúcoffee
doughnuts‚Äù
holds during the interval 7AM-8AM and 4PM-5PM every
day (i.e., every 24 hours), then ‚Äúcoffee
doughnuts‚Äù has
two cycles:
We say that a cycle    	 	
is a multiple of another cycle
 
holds. By
definition, once a cycle exists, all of its multiples with
length less than or equal to

will exist. Therefore, it
is only interesting to discover ‚Äúlarge‚Äù cycles, where a large
cycle is the one that is not multiple of any other cycle. A
time unit	
is said to be ‚Äúpart of a cycle‚Äù
holds.
An association rule can be represented as a binary sequence
where the ones correspond to the time units in
which the rule holds and the zeros correspond to the time
units in which the rule does not have the minimum confidence
or support. For instance, if the binary sequence
001100010101 represents the association rule then 
holds in
is a cycle since the corresponding rule
holds within every fourth time unit starting from time unit
 cycle can also be represented by a binary sequence.
For example, cycle 4
can also be represented as 0001.
Similar to association rules, itemsets can also be represented
as binary sequences where ones correspond to time
units in which the corresponding itemset is large and zeros
correspond to time units in which the corresponding itemset
does not have the minimum support. Also, an itemset is
said to be cyclic, if the itemset is large at regular intervals
(i.e., the sequence representing the itemset is cyclic).
