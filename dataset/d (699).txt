An update from a sensing agent is typically routed directly to
the site manager that owns the relevant node in the hierarchy. On
the site manager side, processing a sensor update involves updating
the document at the site with the new availability information, as
well as timestamping the data. A single site manager is typically
able to handle 200 updates a second in our current prototype. The
total number of updates that can be handled by the system scales
linearly with the number of site managers among which the data is
distributed.
