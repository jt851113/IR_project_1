Each test time series is a synthetic time-series databases
generated using a randomized periodicity data generation
algorithm. From a set of features, potentially frequent 1-
patterns are composed. The size of the potentially frequent
1-patterns is determined based on a Poisson distribution.
These patterns are generated and put into the time-series
according to an exponential distribution.
The basic parameters used to generate the synthetic
databases are listed in Table 1. The parameters of LENGTH? 
(the length of time series) and
(a period) are independently
chosen. The parameters of MAX-PAT-LENGTH (the maximal
-length of frequent patterns) and (the number of frequent 
1-patterns) are for a fixed, and they are controlled
by the choice of some appropriate confidence threshold.
We found that other parameters, such as the number of
features occurring at a fixed position and the number of features
in the time series, do not have much impact on the
performance result and thus they are not considered in the
tests.
