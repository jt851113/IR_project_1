Definition 2.5 Given a pattern with period
and a sequence of events
we say that P matches D' (or D' supports P),itff D' is in compliance
with P at every position j (1<=j<=l). 

For the sake of simplicity of exploration, we assume that, without additional
tional qualification,occurs equally likely at any position with probability
All results presented in this paper can be modified to apply to a
more general scenario.
Another way of looking at it is that at any time.
