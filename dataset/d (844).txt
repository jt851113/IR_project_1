In directed diffusion, task descriptions are named by, for
example, a list of attribute-value pairs that describe a task.
The animal tracking task described in Section 2 might be
described as (this is a simplified description, see Section 3.2
for more details):
type = four-legged animal // detect animal location
interval = 20 ms // send back events every 20 ms
duration = I0 seconds II .. for the next 10 seconds
rect = [-100, i00, 200, 400] // from sensors within rectangle
For ease of exposition, we choose the subregion representation
to be a rectangle defined on some coordinate system;
in practice, this might be based on GPS coordinates.
Intuitively, the task description specifies an interest for data
matching the attributes. For this reason, such a task description
is called an interest. The data sent in response
to interests are also named using a similar naming scheme.
Thus, for example, a sensor that detects an animal might
generate the following data (see Section 3.3 for an explanation
of some of these attributes):
type = four-legged animal //
instance = elephant //
location = [125, 220] //
intensity = 0.6 //
confidence = 0.85 //
timestamp = 01:20:40 //
type of animal seen
instance of this type
node location
signal amplitude measure
confidence in the match
event generation time
Given a set of tasks supported by a sensor network, then,
selecting a naming scheme is the first step in designing directed
diffusion for the network. For our sensor network, we
have chosen a simple attribute-value based interest and data
naming scheme. In general, each attribute has an associated
value range. For example, the range of the type attribute is
the set of codebook values representing mobile objects (vehicles,
animal, humans). The value of an attribute can be any
subset of its range. In our example, the value of the type
attribute in the interest is that corresponding to four-legged
animals.
There are other choices for attribute value ranges (e.g., hierarchical)
and other naming schemes (such as intentional
names [1]). To some extent, the choice of naming scheme
can affect the expressivity of tasks, and may impact performance
of a diffusion algorithm. In this paper, our goal is
to gain an initial understanding of the diffusion paradigm.
For this reason, we defer the exploration of possible naming
schemes to future work.
