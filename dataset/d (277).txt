Field scientists, particularly biologists and environmental scientists, have long used dataloggers and radio beacons to collect periodic readings about local environmental conditions such as light, temperature or humidity. There are a number of commercial data loggers that are available and widely used in the scienti?c community [6, 15]. Campbell Scienti?c [6] is a well known vendor; their data loggers are relatively large instruments (ranging in size from 36 in3 and weighing 1 pound for small, limited storage devices to 2300 in3 and 40 pounds for larger devices with batteries for long-term remote operation and signi?cant storage [7]) that can interface to a wide range of sensors and are designed to operate in a number of harsh environments. Their newest generation of data loggers includes interfaces to single-hop, point-to-point radios, and the smallest data loggers feature power consumption characteristics that allow them to run on the equivalent of a pair of AA batteries at low duty cycle (e.g., tens or hundreds of samples a day) for months at a time. Larger, more power hungry versions that require large solar cells or a wall-socket offer signi?cantly faster sampling rates and high-precision analog-to-digital converters. Most data-loggers collect readings periodically or according to a scheduled “program” – a set of pre-speci?ed time periods throughout the day. In addition to basic logging facilities, these data loggers support time averaging and the tracking of windowed minima/maxima. In most settings, users are expected to buy a few at a high premium (thousands of dollars apiece, once the cost of sensors and radios is ?gured in – see, for example, the Onset Computer Pricing Page [14]) to monitor a few locations. Due to the relatively small number of loggers, low data rates, simple schemas, and simple (or non-existent) communication technologies involved in these applications, they have not received much attention from the systems community, as we discuss in more detail in Section 2.5.
