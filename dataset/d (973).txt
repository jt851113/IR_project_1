Several experimental studies on real and synthetic data streams were
performed to evaluate and validate the proposed method. Table 2 shows a
summary of the datasets discussed in this work, giving their number of events
(N) and number of attributes (E). The value of D was calculated after each
counting period considering all the events inside the sliding window and using
20 grid sizes (R = 20). The experiments were executed on a P4 3.0GHz, with
0.5GB of RAM, running the MS Windows XP.
