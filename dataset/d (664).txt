4.3.2. Sketch Sizes and Compression As men-
tioned earlier, the other main limitation of sensor net-
works is their limited bandwidth. This limitation is
a cause for concern when comparing sketching based
techniques against the spanning tree strategies of TAG.
While 2 bytes of data per packet will generally suAce
for TAG, a single 16 bit sketch takes the same amount
of space and our later experiments will actually be us-
ing 20 sketches per packet for a single aggregate. How-
ever, as one might guess from Lemma 1, these sketches
are quite compressible. To leverage this, our experi-
ments will use the compression techniques of [18]. In
brief, the sketches are rst \attened", enumerating
the rst bit of each sketch, then the second bit of each
sketch, and so on, and then the result sequence of bits
is run-length encoded. This reduces the space require-
ments to about 30% of uncompressed versions. This is
suAcient for two aggregates to be sketched within one
TinyDB packet (up to 48 bytes).
