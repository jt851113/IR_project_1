Abstract—We present an update on the status of the Cougar
Sensor Database Project in which we are investigating a database
approach to sensor networks: Clients “program” the sensors
through queries in a high-level declarative language (such as a
variant of SQL). In this paper, we give an overview of our activities
on energy-efficient data dissemination and query processing.
Due to space constraints, we cannot present a full menu of results;
instead, we decided to only whet the reader’s appetite with some
interesting problems in energy-efficient routing and in-network
aggregation and some thoughts on how to approach them.
