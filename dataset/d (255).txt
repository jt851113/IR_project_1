Once queries have been disseminated and optimized, the query processor begins executing them. Query execution is straightforward, so we describe it only brie?y.

We present simple schemes for prioritizing data in selection queries, brie?y discuss prioritizing data in aggregation queries, and then turn to adaptation. We discuss two situations in which adaptation is necessary: when the radio is highly contented and when power consumption is more rapid than expected.
