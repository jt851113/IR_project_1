The key components of our design are (a) temporal filtering (b)
wavRoute, our routing protocol for spatial wavelet subband decomposition
(c) distributed long-term storage through adaptive wavelet
thresholding. We outline key features of the system, and discuss
cost metrics that tradeoff communication, computation, storage complexity,
and system performance. A few usage models of the storage
system are described, including multi-resolution data extraction,
spatio-temporal data mining, and feature routing. To facilitate
the description, we use a simplified grid topology model, whose parameters
are defined in Table 2. We expect to relax this assumption
in future work (Section 8).
The approach to DIMENSIONS is based on wavelet subband
coding, a popular signal processing technique for multiresolution
analysis and compression [5, 6]. Wavelets offer numerous advantages
over other signal processing techniques for viewing a spatiotemporal
dataset (a) ability to view the data at multiple spatial and
temporal scales (b) ability to extract important features in the data
such as abrupt changes at various scales thereby obtaining good
compression (c) easy distributed implementation and (d) low computation
and memory overhead. The crucial observation behind
wavelet thresholding when applied to compression is that for typical
time-series signals, a few coefficients suffice for reasonably
accurate signal reconstruction.
