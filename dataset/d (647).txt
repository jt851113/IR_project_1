Today's sensor motes (e.g. [12]) are full edged com-
puter systems, with a CPU, main memory, operat-
ing system and a suite of sensors. They are powered
by small batteries and their lifetime is primarily de-
pendent on the extent to which battery power is con-
served. The power consumption tends to be dominated
by transmitting and receiving messages and most sys-
tems try to minimize the number of messages in order
to save power. Also, the communication between sen-
sors is wireless and the packet loss rate between nodes
can be high. For example, [23] reports on experiments
in which more than 10% of the links suered average
loss rate greater than 50%. Another challenge is that
links may be asymmetric, both in loss rates and even
reachability. These limitations motivate query evalua-
tion methods in sensor networks that are fundamen-
tally dierent from the traditional distributed query
evaluation approaches. First, the query execution plan
must be energy eAcient and second, the process must
be as robust as possible given the communication lim-
itations in these networks.
