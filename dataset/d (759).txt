Collections of large graphs were built to help in understanding genetics. These graphs
commonly have tens of thousands of nodes and are noisy. For about 5 years, extracting
knowledge by crossing such graphs has been a hot topic. For example, there is a
need to extract patterns that remain valid across several co-expression graphs obtained
from microarray data or to cross the data pertaining to physical interactions between
molecules (e. g., protein-protein, protein-gene) with more conceptual data (e. g., coexpression
of genes, co-occurrence of proteins in the literature). One of the most
promising pattern helping in these tasks is the closed quasi-3-clique. Crochet+ (Jiang
and Pei 2009) and Cocain* (Zeng et al. 2007) are the state-of-the-art extractors of
closed quasi-3-cliques. They all use the same definition of noise tolerance: every node
implied in a pattern must have, in every graph independently from the others, a degree
exceeding a user-defined proportion of the maximal degree it would reach if the clique
was exact. Thus, a pattern involving a subset T of the graphs and a subset N of the
nodes needs to satisfy |T × N| constraints to be a quasi-3-clique, i. e., one constraint
per couple (timestamp, node). This definition of noise tolerance is different from the
one involved in the definition of the closed ET-n-sets Fenster extracts. Indeed, in
Definition 5, an upper-bounded number of absent n-tuples (rather than a proportion)
is tolerated per element involved in the pattern, i. e., (T, Ntail, Nhead) is, by definition,
an ET-3-set iff:
- ?t ? T , the dynamic graph contains all 3-tuples in {t}×Ntail×Nhead but timestamps
or less.
- ?ntail ? Ntail, the dynamic graph contains all 3-tuples in T × {ntail} × Nhead but
tail or less.
- ?nhead ? Nhead, the dynamic graph contains all 3-tuples in T × Ntail ×{nhead} but
head or less.
In this way, (T, Ntail, Nhead) needs to satisfy |T| + |Ntail| + |Nhead| constraints to be
an ET-3-set. If only symmetric patterns are considered, i. e., Ntail = Nhead = N, this
number becomes |T| + 2|N|. In the specific context of undirected graphs (contrary
to Fenster, none of the previously cited approaches can deal with directed graphs),
the constraints Fenster applies on the tails and on the heads are identical. As a consequence,
only |T| + |N| constraints defines a symmetric ET-3-set. By comparing
this number to |T × N|, it can be written that it is easier for a pattern to be an ET-
3-set than a quasi-clique in the sense of Crochet+ or Cocain* (the patterns involving
only one timestamp or one node are exceptions to this assertion but they are not very
interesting). As a consequence our approach does not scale well to graphs connecting
thousands of nodes. Nevertheless, because Fenster indifferently enumerates timestamps
and nodes (no attribute is favored), it can extract closed symmetric ET-3-sets
in large collections of smaller graphs, whereas the other algorithms cannot (or they
must be used with a very strong minimal size constraint on the number of involved
graphs). Finally, (Sim et al. 2011) is a recent proposal that is again less generic than
Fenster (ternary relations only, one particular dimension).
