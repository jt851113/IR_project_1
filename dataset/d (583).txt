In this section, we analyze the latency incurred by ACQUIRE in answering a query.
ACQUIRE takes SM steps to answer a query of size M, where SM is given by equation 6 in
section 4.2.1. Each of these steps involve an update phase, where in a request is propagated
within a neighborhood of d hops, while the responses are propagated over a maximum of
d hops. Moreover, once the query is completely resolved, the response is sent back to the
querier (modelled as   dSM). Also, the update phase will be done only once every 1
c
queries. Thus, the average latency of ACQUIRE can be given as follows:
For the random walk,
