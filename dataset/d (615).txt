A wireless network consisting of a large number of
small sensors with low-power transceivers can be an effective tool
for gathering data in a variety of environments. The data
collected by each sensor is communicated through the network to
a single processing center that uses all reported data to determine
characteristics of the environment or detect an event. The
communication or message passing process must be designed to
conserve the limited energy resources of the sensors. Clustering
sensors into groups, so that sensors communicate information
only to clusterheads and then the clusterheads communicate the
aggregated information to the processing center, may save
energy. In this paper, we propose a distributed, randomized
clustering algorithm to organize the sensors in a wireless sensor
network into clusters. We then extend this algorithm to generate
a hierarchy of clusterheads and observe that the energy savings
increase with the number of levels in the hierarchy. Results in
stochastic geometry are used to derive solutions for the values of
parameters of our algorithm that minimize the total energy spent
in the network when all sensors report data through the
clusterheads to the processing center.
