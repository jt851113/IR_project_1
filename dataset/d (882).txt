We define the communication cost C as the amount of
messages which have been sent, including query request messages,
result messages and update informing messages. For
clarity of presentation, we simply denote the size of a single
message as m. Note that, we can set different sizes for different
types of messages. We now investigate the process of
query routing and IA value updating to analyze the cost of
communication.
As mentioned before, the length of query path is l if the
result is found. Otherwise the number of routing hops is
equal to TTL. During the query routing, each node chooses
one of its neighbors by checking its own index, then forwards
the query request to that neighbor, which sends only one
message. So does the result returning process. Therefore,
the communication cost C is
C = 2× (l ? 1) × m, l ? TTL

The IA value updating process is one of the key processes
in our model, because many processes are essentially
IA value updating processes, such as node joining/leaving
process, data adding/deleting process and data modifying
process. For a node i, we assume that it has ni neighbors.
In the updating process, node i sends only one message mi
to each of ni neighbors. After receiving the message, those
ni neighbors just update their own NI table and nothing
more need to be done. The communication cost of node i’s
IA value renewing is
C = m× ni
