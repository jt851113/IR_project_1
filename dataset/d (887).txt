We exploit the following performance metrics:
‧ Query Traffic: the amount of traffic that is incurred
by the query propagation in the whole network. It is
clear that query traffic is affected by the query rate γ.
But, in this experiment, we only compare the traffic
of different approaches with the same γ, because the
interval trends of those approaches are similar with
different γ.
‧ Communication Traffic: the total number of messages
that are transferred during the whole simulation.
In our approach, we compute this cost according to the
model discussed in Section 3.4.1 and we count only
the messages produced in the application layer. It reflects
the whole network traffic. If an approach incurs
too much communication traffic, it wastes more bandwidth.
‧ Query Response Time: the overall duration from
query execution, i.e., from the time that a query is
issued until the result is received. Response time is
one of the important criterions of query efficiency. We
aim at shortening the response time to improve the
performance.
‧ Query Success Rate: the percentage of queries that
have eventually received the required resource data. It
is denoted as

‧ Energy Consumption: we measure the energy consumption
of a node while it participates in the whole
query routing process. We follow the aforementioned
model proposed in Section 3.4.2. In reality, users are
very sensitive to the energy consumption of the battery,
because it imposes a great impact on the using
time of mobile devices.
