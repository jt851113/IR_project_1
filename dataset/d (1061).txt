In this paper, we discussed novel techniques for diagnosing
different kinds of trends in evolving data streams. The
velocity density estimation technique is used in order to
generate two kinds of profiles: spatial velocity profiles and
temporal velocity profiles, each of which provide a different
kind of insight into the nature of the changes in the
underlying data characteristics. We proposed techniques
for finding useful trends in higher-dimensional problems
by finding specific combinations of dimensions in which the
greatest change has occurred. Finally, the techniques are
used in order to provide an effective diagnosis of the
regions of coagulations, dissolutions, and shifts in the data.
With a few exceptions, most of the results of this paper can
be computed in a single online scan of the data. The results
of this paper have considerable implications for the
increasingly important problem of detecting trends in data
streams and spatiotemporal data.
