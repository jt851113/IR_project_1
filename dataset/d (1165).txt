Our goal is to develop an Internet-scale continuous query system
using group optimization based on the assumption that many
continuous queries on the Internet will have some similarities.
Previous group optimization approaches consider grouping only
a small number of queries at the same time and are not scalable
to millions of queries. We propose a new “incremental
grouping” methodology that makes group optimization more
scalable than the previous approaches. This idea can be applied
to very general group optimization methods. We also propose a
grouping method using a query-split scheme that requires
minimal changes to a general purposed query engine. In our
system, both timer-based and change-based continuous queries
can be grouped together for event detection and group
execution, a capability not found in other systems. Other
techniques to make our system scalable include incremental
evaluation of continuous queries, use of both pull and push
models for detecting heterogeneous data source changes and a
caching mechanism. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that
our incremental group optimization significantly improves the
execution time comparing to non-grouping approach. The
results of experiments also show that the system can be scaled to
support very large number of queries.
