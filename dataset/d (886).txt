In the simulation, we set the scenario of a 1000m×1000m
area. Within this area, the mobile nodes move according
to the Random Waypoint Mobility Model [5]. In particular,
at the beginning of the simulation Ns percentage of all N
mobile nodes are randomly placed in this area. Each node
has a destination which is another random point within the
space. The node moves to its destination at a constant speed
s along the straight line. After it arrives, it pauses at the
destination for a period ts, then randomly chooses another
destination, and repeats this procedure. Nd (Ns + Nd = 1)
percentage of nodes are randomly placed outside the area.
Each of them moves toward a random destination within
the area at speed s and pauses at the destination for td.
After that, it moves toward outside of the area and is removed
from the simulation. The pause time ts is uniformly
distributed between 120 and 240 seconds for stable nodes.
td is uniformly distributed between 30 and 60 seconds for
highly dynamic nodes. The motion speed s is randomly
selected from the interval [0.5, 1.5] miles/hour for modeling
the pedestrian scenario. This mobility model simulates,
for example, the motion of workers and visitors at business
district. Within the area, there are D identical data resources
and each of them has two replicas randomly distributed
among nodes. Every node selects a random data
for issuing a query. The query rate is γ. All mobile nodes
use IEEE 802.11 for connection. The bandwidth is 10 Mbps
and the transmission range is 100 meters. The parameters
used are listed in Table 1.
