In this set of experiments, we evaluate the query response
time for successful queries. Adopting the typical policy in
many mobile networks, we set a time threshold for queries,
and assume a query fails if its issuer does not get any reply
within the threshold. In Figure 7, we show the average query
response time of all successful queries in the network by
varying the network size and data cardinality. The flooding
approach has the shortest response time owing to its fully
distributed nature. Our IA approach is faster than Eureka,
which means IA has shorter query paths than Eureka on
average. As we can see, Eureka is a constrained distributed
approach which propagates queries in a selective and parallel
way. IA has only one but probably most optimal query path,
thus it outperforms Eureka. This is owing to the advantages
of its Intelligence Accuracy evaluation technique as well as
the cooperation of each node. Meanwhile, the gaps among
IA, Eureka and flooding are getting smaller when network
size becomes larger, because the query paths of all three
approaches get closer to TTL for larger networks.
