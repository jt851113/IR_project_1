The definition of a closed n-set is too strict to enable the discovery of relevant patterns
in noisy n-ary relations. The definition of a closed ET-n-set relaxes that of a closed
n-set. It is based on absolute noise-tolerance parameters  = (i )i=1..n ? Nn. Given
, the type of pattern that is to be mined is defined by a conjunction of two constraints,
namely C-connected and C-closed.
Definition 5 (C-connected) Given an n-set X, C-connected(X) â‰¡ ?i = 1..n, ?e ? Xi ,
|(X1 Ã—Â· Â· Â·Ã—{e}Ã—Â· Â· Â·Ã— Xn) \ R| ? i .
Definition 6 (C-closed) Given an n-set X, C-closed(X) â‰¡ ?X ? Ã—j=1..n2Dj ,
X  X ? C-connected(X
) ? X = X.
Definition 7 (ClosedET-n-set) Given an n-set X, X is a closedET-n-set iff C-connected
(X) ? C-closed(X).
Let us discuss the meaning of the noise-tolerance parameters on a closed ET-n-set
(X1, . . . , Xn). The parameter i quantifies, on any element in Xi , the maximal number
of n-tuples that are allowed to be absent fromR. In other terms, with a spatial vision of
a pattern (an n-dimensional rectangle in R modulo permutations of the hyperplanes),
i is the maximal number of â€˜0â€™s on any hyperplane of the ith dimension. Furthermore
C-closed forces (X1, . . . , Xn) to be closed, i. e., any extension of it violates C-connected.
If ?i = 1..n, i = 0 then C-connected â‰¡ Cconnected and C-closed â‰¡ Cclosed. The closed
ET-n-set is a generalization of the closed n-set.
It is said that the definition of a closed ET-n-set uses an absolute noise-tolerance
because it considers numbers rather than proportions of â€˜0â€™s. The following function
helps in referring to counts of n-tuples absent from R on any element of an n-set.
Definition 8 (Function 0) Given an n-set X, ?i = 1..n, ?e ? Di, 0(X, e) = |(X1 Ã—
Â· Â· Â·Ã—{e}Ã—Â· Â· Â·Ã— Xn) \ R|.
Example 2 Table 2 shows the hyperplane of the 3-set X = ({Î±, Î³ }, {1, 2, 3}, {B})
related to the element B in the third attribute domain of RE (Table 1). It contains only
one absent 3-tuple, (Î³, 3, B), i.e., 0(X, B) = 1.
The following property states that the function 0(., e) is increasing w.r.t.  and its
proof is straightforward.
Property 1 (0(., e) is increasing) ?i = 1..n, ?e ? Di , ?(X, X
) ? (Ã—j=1..n2Dj)2,
Let us use the 0 function to rewrite Definitions 5 and 6:
Definition 9 (C-connected) Given an n-set X, C-connected(X) â‰¡ ?i = 1..n, ?e ? Xi ,
0(X, e) ? i .
Definition 10 (C-closed) Given an n-set X, C-closed(X) â‰¡ ?i = 1..n, ?e ? Di \ Xi ,
0(X, e) > i
or
? j = i , ? f ? X j s.t. 0((X1, . . . , Xi âˆª {e}, . . . , Xn), f ) > j.
Definition 9 is a direct rewriting of Definition 5. Definition 10 is more than that. It
is equivalent to Definition 6 because if a pattern can be extended without violating
C-connected, then there is such an extensionwith one element only (and the reverse obviously
is true too). Furthermore, Definition 10 details the twoways to break C-connected.
Either the element to extend the closed ET-n-set gathers, when projected on the pattern,
too many n-tuples absent from R or this additional element makes the number of â€˜0â€™s
on an orthogonal element (an element from another domain of the relation) exceed
the related noise-tolerance parameter.
Example 3 Let  = (1, 1, 1). X = ({Î±, Î³ }, {1, 2, 3}, {B}) is a closed ET-3-set in RE .
X satisfies C-connected since each of its hyperplanes contains, at most, one 3-tuple
absent from RE: 0(X, Î±) = 0, 0(X, Î³ ) = 1, 0(X, 1) = 0, 0(X, 2) = 0, 0(X, 3) = 1
and 0(X, B) = 1. X satisfies C-closed because extending it with any additional element
either means that the hyperplane of X on this element contains strictly more than
one 3-tuple absent from RE (e. g., 0(X, Î²) = 2) or at least one of the hyperplanes
on an orthogonal element in X would contain strictly more than one 3-tuple absent
from RE (e. g., 4 cannot extend X because 0(({Î±, Î³ }, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {B}), B) = 2).
(Î±, Î², Î³ }, {1, 2}, {A, B}) is another closed ET-3-set in RE .
If a pattern is not -connected then none of its super-patterns (w.r.t. ) is:
Property 2 (Anti-monotonicity of C-connected) ?(X, X
) ? (Ã—j=1..n2Dj)2,
X  X ??C-connected(X)??C-connected(X).
Proof By Definition 9, ?C-connected(X) means that ?i = 1..n, ?e ? Xi s.t. 0(X, e) >
i . By Definition 2, (e ? Xi ? X  X
) ? e ? Xi . Finally, by Property 1, 0(X, e) ?
0(X, e) > i, i.e., ?C-connected(X). 
If a pattern is not -closed then none of its sub-patterns (w.r.t. ) is:
Property 3 (Monotonicity of C-closed) ?(X, X
) ? (Ã—j=1..n2Dj
)2,
X  X ??C-closed(X
)??C-closed(X).
Proof By Definition 10, ?C-closed(X
) means that ?i = 1..n, ?e ? Di \ Xi such that
0(X, e) ? i ? ?j = i , ? f ? X j , 0((X1, . . . , Xi âˆª {e}, . . . , Xn), f ) ?  j. By
Definition 2, (e ? Di \ Xi ? X  X
) ? e ? Di \ Xi . By Property 1, 0(X, e) ?0(X
, e) ? i (1). By Definition 2, ? j = i , ? f ? X j , ( f ? X j ? X  X) ?
f ? X j and, by Property 1, 0((X1, . . . , Xi âˆª {e}, . . . , Xn), f ) ? 0((X1, . . . , Xi âˆª
{e}, . . . , Xn), f ) ?  j (2). Together, (1) and (2) mean ?C-closed(X). 
