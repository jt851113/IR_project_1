Counting sketches were introduced by Flajolet and
Martin in [7] for the purpose of quickly estimating the
number of distinct items in a database (or stream) in
one pass while using only a small amount of space.
Since then, there has been much work developing and
generalizing counting sketches (e.g. [1, 6, 10, 3, 9, 2]).
It is well known that exact solutions to the distinct
counting problem require 
(n) space. As shown in [1],
(log n) space is required to approximate the number
of distinct items in a multi-set with n distinct items.
The original FM sketches of [7] achieve this bound,
though they assume a xed hash function that appears
random, so they are vulnerable to adversarial choices
of inputs. We use these sketches since they are very
small and accurate in practice, and describe them in
detail in Section 3.
A dierent sketching scheme using linear hash func-
tions was proposed in [1]. These sketches are somewhat
larger than FM sketches in practice, although a very re-
cent technique [5] extending these methods uses only
O(log log n) space. We intend to investigate the eec-
tiveness of these \loglog" sketches for sensor databases
in future work.
