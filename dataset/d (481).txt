3.5 Discussion: Sophisticated OIS Pruning with Superfluous
Gain Elimination In this section, we discuss some techniques
that can provide a better estimation of the value OIS.
In section 3.2, we only consider the case that the gap between
two consecutive occurrences of an event  exceeds the period
when the information loss is calculated. We now examine the
case that the gap is less than the period. Let‚Äôs first consider the
scenario that  repeats itself perfectly at certain distance  in
a subsequence . For every occurrence of  (except the first
and last one) at position  within , we can observe two companion
occurrences of  at position    and   , referred
to as the backward and forward companion, respectively. Figure
9(a) shows a series of 4 occurrences of event  with period
3, each of which (e.g., at position  ) has two companions
at the third preceding position (e.g., 	) and the third subsequent
position (e.g., 	) of the current one. The total generalized
information gain of the pattern    generated from
the subsequence is . The above claim also holds
in the case where an event occurs multiple times within a period.
Figure 9(b), shows two overlapping series of repetitions of
 which may bring  generalized information
gain to pattern   .
As we mentioned before, the net information gain  can
contribute to a pattern is much confined if one of the following
is true.
1. Some information loss would incur due to the absence of
 at some position. This absence can be viewed as a
companion absence of the neighboring occurrence(s). For
example, the circled position in Figure 9(c) is considered as
an absence of  for pattern   . This absence makes
both position 	 and position 	 lose one companion.
2. Some misaligned occurrence of  has to be treated as
an eternal event or even as an absence of some other
event and hence no generalized information gain can be
collected from it. These occurrences usually are associated
with companion absences. The third occurrences of 
in Figure 9(c) have to be treated as an eternal event for
pattern    and treated as ‚Äúabsence of ‚Äù for pattern
  . We also observe that in Figure 9(c) the event
 at position 	 has no companion at both position 	
and position 	.
It is obvious that all of these suboptimal scenarios would
weaken the net generalized information gain that  may contribute
to any pattern. By carefully identifying companion absence
and assessing its impact to the generalized information
gain, we can obtain a tighter estimation of the net contribution
to the generalized information gain that  could make to any
pattern in   . Since the companionship is essentially a
mutual relationship, we choose to examine the backward companion
to avoid looking forward in the event sequence. This is
achieved by employing an additional discipline to estimate the
OIS that an event  might contribute to any pattern in   .
	 3. For each occurrence of  at position  , if the distance
to the previous occurrence of  is less than , then the
previous occurrence of  is not the backward companion
of  at position  . So an information adjustment of
 is needed.
The new calculation of  is as follows.
  	  	
      #  
        
      $    
            
where #   is the product of  and the number of
occurrences of  in the previous  events prior to the th
occurrence of . Here $   is the adjustment according
to the third discipline stated above. The revised computation of
 is shown in Figure 10(a).
For each period length , the addition storage requirement to
perform the generalized information gain adjustment is an array
of  elements (to store the previous  events). The computation
complexity remains the same.
Finally, we give some rationale for the third discipline. Intuitively,
when the companion absence is present, the generalized
information gain would not be as high as expected. Some
adjustment needs to be taken to provide a tighter estimation.
Let‚Äôs reconsider the example shown in Figure 5(a), which is also
described in Figure 10(b).   ,   , and   
are the three possible patterns that involve  because  only
appears at the second and third position on each segment.
	 The adjustment in position 8 comes from the following
reasons. The solid ovals indicate the adjustments that are
taken according to the third discipline. For   , comparing
the actual information gain/loss with the previous
estimation in section 3.2, the generalized information gain
on position 6 is superfluous. For   , the generalized
information gain on position 8 is superfluous, while the information
on position 6 for pattern    is superfluous.
Therefore, by position 8, one generalized information
gain of 0.87 is superfluous for all patterns, thus, we adjust
the generalized information gain by -0.87.
	 The adjustment in position 15 is necessary because of
the following reasons. Generalized information gain on
position 14 and 15 is superfluous for pattern    and
  , respectively, due to the similar reasons described
above. For   , on position 11 and 12, we need
to deduct generalized information gain by 1.74; however,
we only deduct generalized information gain by 0.87 on
position 14. As a result, an additional 0.87 needs to be
deducted from the net generalized information gain. Thus,
we add an adjustment of -0.87 on position 15.
	 On position 20, another adjustment is created. There are
two superfluous information gain of 0.87 on position 18
and 20 for   . Also, there is one superfluous
information gain of 0.87 by position for both   
and    as indicated in Figure 10(b). Therefore, one
generalized information gain adjustment of -0.87 is created
on position 20.
As a rule of thumb, for an event , the adjustment is postponed
until the time it would apply to all possible patterns involving
. Therefore, the new estimation could be used as a tighter
bound on the generalized information gain.
