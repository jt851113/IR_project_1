We have discussed several coordination services
for wireless sensor networks. The
general applicability of these services is demonstrated
both through their use with
applications and through the way they build
upon each other. We expect that the availability
of this toolkit of wireless sensor network
services will aid in the future development of
structural health monitoring systems.
