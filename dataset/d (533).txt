In this section, we present experimental results on fulltext
search in a P2P network. Our goal is to increase the
quality of the answers in a manner that reduces the overall
cost in comparison to existing methods. The collection we
use comprises blog data crawled from BlogSpot.4 Altogether
we have 10, 000 blogs with a total of 1, 014, 356 posts (documents).
We divided the data between 1, 000 logical peers,
resulting in about 1, 000 documents per peer. The peers use
the Lucene5 open-source system for retrieving and ranking
their documents.
We have experimented with 75 queries taken from the blog
track6 of TREC 2008. The number of terms in the queries
ranges from two to seven.
