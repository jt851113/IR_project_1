In this paper, we discuss several recent research advances
for mining patterns in time series data given the presence of
noise. They not only provide more suitable models to measure
interesting patterns but also enable scalable solutions
to mine patterns under the proposed models with respect
to the size of input data. Interested readers are welcome to
refer to the individual papers for further information.
