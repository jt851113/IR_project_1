In this experiment, we measure the average time for building
indexes. When a node joins the network, its index is constructed
to allow its content to be searched. Full indexing strategy requires
the node to publish all the local sharable data, which may last for
hours. Instead, PISCES can significantly reduce the joining time.
We do note that peers are likely to be more stable in a corporate
network compared to a social network, and this is even more so,
when the collaboration affects the companiesâ€™ profits and losses
(P&L). However, being a peer-to-peer network, we do not discount
node churning and respect the autonomy of peers.
As shown in Figure 12, setup time in both strategies increases as
we increase the data size(the time is shown in log scale). However,
data size has less effect on PISCES and it has a setup process with
less than 10 seconds in most cases.
