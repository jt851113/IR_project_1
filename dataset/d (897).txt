Abstract -- We apply sensor networks to the problem of tracking
moving objects. We describe a publish-and-subscribe tracking
method, called Scalable Tracking Using Networked Sensors
(STUN), that scales well to large numbers of sensors and moving
objects by using hierarchy. We also describe a method, called
drain-and-balance (DAB), for building efficient tracking hierarchies,
computed from expected characteristics of the objectsâ€™
movement patterns. DAB is shown to perform well by running it
on 1D and 2D sensor network topologies, and comparing it to
schemes which do not utilize movement information.
