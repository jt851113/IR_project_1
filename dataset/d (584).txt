In ERS, on an average the ring has to expand till tmin hops to get updates, where tmin is
given by Eqn. 16. The latency in executing a ring of size x is 2x, x for the request and x for
the reply. Moreover, these updates are sought once every 1
c queries. The remaining fraction
of the queries are answered from the cached responses (which has a latency of 0). Thus, the
average latency in ERS is given as follows:
