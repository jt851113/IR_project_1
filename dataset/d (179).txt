We present the Tiny AGgregation (TAG) service for aggregation in low-power, distributed, wireless environments. TAG allows users to express simple, declarative queries and have them distributed and executed ef?ciently in networks of low-power, wireless sensors. We discuss various generic properties of aggregates, and show how those properties affect the performance of our in network approach. We include a performance study demonstrating the advantages of our approach over traditional centralized, out-of-network methods, and discuss a variety of optimizations for improving the performance and faulttolerance of the basic solution
