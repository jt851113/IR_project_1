5.1 Mining Sequence Data Most previous work on mining
sequence data fell into two categories: discovering sequential
patterns [1, 3, 4, 6, 15, 24, 29] and mining periodic patterns
[9, 10, 16, 26]. The primary difference between them is that
the models of sequential pattern purely take into account the
number of occurrences of the pattern while the frameworks for
periodic patterns focus on characterizing cyclic behaviors.
