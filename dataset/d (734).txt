Binary relation mining has been extensively studied. Nevertheless, many
interesting 0/1 data naturally appear as n-ary relations with n ? 3. A timely challenge
is to extend local pattern extraction, e. g., closed pattern mining, to such contexts.
When considering higher arities, faint noise affects more and more the quality of the
extracted patterns. We study a declarative specification of error-tolerant patterns by
means of new primitive constraints and the design of an efficient algorithm to extract
every solution pattern. It exploits the enumeration principles of the state-of-the-art
Data-Peeler algorithm for n-ary relation mining. Efficiently enforcing error-tolerance
crucially depends on innovative strategies to incrementally compute partial information
on the data. Our prototype is tested on both synthetic and real datasets. It returns
relevant collections of patterns even in the case of noisy ternary or 4-ary relations,
e. g., in the context of pattern discovery from dynamic networks.
