In this section, we attempt to analytically compare the average latency in obtaining a response
to a query by these 3 mechanisms. The metric for latency that we examine is the
expected number of sequential transmissions required before a response is obtained to a given
query. We should note that this is a network layer analysis that does not take into account
MAC delay due to contentions.
