In this section, we focus on the properties of sensors and
streaming data that must be taken into account when designing
the low level infrastructure needed to efficiently integrate
streaming sensor data into a query processor. There
are other important issues in sensor stream processing, such
as query language and algebra design and the detailed semantics
of stream operators, which are not the focus of this
work. We discuss these in more detail in Section 6.
