This paper presents TD-DES, a data event scheduling
and dissemination protocol specifically designed for wireless
multi-hop networks of energy-constrained devices. TD-DES
is intended as an application overlay to a CSMA/CA wireless
MAC layer (such as 802.11 MAC DCF [6] and MACA
[24]), rather than a MAC/networking layer in itself.
