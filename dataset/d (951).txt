The key advantage of Fjords
is that they allow distributed query plans to use a mixture
of push and pull connections between operators. Push or
pull is implemented by the queue: a push queue relies on its
input operator to	

data into it which the output operator
can later. A pull queue actively requests that the input
operator produce data (by calling itsmethod) in response to
acall on the part of the output operator.
Push queues make sensor streams feasible. When a sensor
tuple arrives at a sensor proxy, that proxy pushes those
tuples onto the input queues of the queries which use it as a
source. The operators draining those queues never actively
call the sensor proxy; they merely operate on sensor data as
it is pushed into them. With this high level view of Fjords
in mind, We now present a detailed view of the internals of
a Fjord operator.
