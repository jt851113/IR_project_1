By running the application and role assignment modules separately,
we have simplified our evaluation approach. This approach
has some disadvantages such as limited ability to communicate
complex resource monitoring results. Transferring
every detail of the running state from the fusion module to
the placement module is prohibitive in our decoupled setup due
to the resulting network perturbation. Such perturbation, even
when minimal state is being communicated between the modules,
prevents accurate network delay metric usage in a cost
function. However, our simplified evaluation design has allowed
us to rapidly build prototypes of the fusion and placement
modules.
