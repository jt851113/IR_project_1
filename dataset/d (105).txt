The basic procedure applied in all evaluations of this section
is to judge the quality of a peer ranking by the quality
of the results that will be retrieved if peers are visited in the
order implied by the ranking.
The top 100 peers are visited according to the peer ranking,
and effectiveness of the resulting merged document ranking
(the best 1,000 documents found so far) is measured after
visiting each peer. In all cases, if there is no peer left with a
score greater than 0, the next best peer is chosen randomly.
Because document scores are comparable across all peers
(cf. section 3.1), merging rankings is trivial: when visiting
peer i, its set of documents is united with the documents
found at peers 1, .., i- 1 and the resulting set of documents
is sorted by the documentsâ€™ global scores and pruned to a
length of 1,000.
