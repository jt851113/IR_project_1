We presented an effective and efficient method for fulltext
search in an environment of autonomous peers that are
organized as a structured P2P network. Our approach is
based on locally partitioning the collection of each peer and
using two-dimensional histograms that describe score distributions.
The experiments showed an improvement of more
than 50% in the recall compared to state-of-the-art methods
when accessing the same number of peers. By using the
two-phase and adaptive algorithms, we can further improve
the recall while reducing the communication cost.
For future work, we plan to investigate other types of histograms;
for example, equi-depth histograms for the score
dimension. Another important problem is how to efficiently
maintain the histograms in a dynamic environment, where
the document collections of the peers are constantly updated
and peers can join and leave the network.
