Given a set of events generated by an object moving through the network, the objects position and velocity at each event can be estimated using this algorithm. Figures 4a and 4b display the performance of the above algorithm as a single object moves through a sensor field. In this example, the object originates at position (5,5), and traverses the network at an unknown velocity taken from a uniform distribution bounded by Vmax. The state noise is zero for the simulations.
To view the performance of the algorithm over time, 50 such simulations were run for randomly generated networks and objects, and the results can be shown in Figure 4b. While the position estimate is initially quite small due to the relatively small sensing radii, the velocity estimate takes several transitions to converge.
The performance of the estimator will vary considerably for different network setups, but an analysis of this is beyond the scope of this paper. It may also be noted from figure 4a that a 3-sigma gate successfully associates the subsequent events in the sequence.
While not optimal by any means, this algorithm provides an increasingly accurate state estimate as more events are associated,
and the gating property allows the associations to become increasingly selective as time progresses.
