TD-DES’s main function is to govern when each node of a
network (1) receives data, (2) transmits data, and (3) powers
its radio down to a low-power standby mode. These
radio modes – Tx, Rx, and standby – are cycled among as
functions of time determined by the network’s dissemination
schedule, which is generated primarily by the root node and
propagated down the tree as part of a control event. The
root node is assumed to be a base station with greater computational,
storage, and transmission capabilities than the
rest of the nodes in the network. The root node typically
serves an entry point to the sensor network, integrating the
sensor network with the external wired network where the
monitoring task GUI resides. As we will describe in Section
3, the scheduler relies on topology information, event profiles,
traffic statistics, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) expectations
when generating dissemination schedules. The basic
goal of the scheduler is to minimize network-wide power consumption
(by minimizing the amount of time spent in the
Rx and Tx modes) without sacrificing timely dissemination
of data.
