At the other end of the emerging sensor data space are networks of large, desktop-PC class devices that are batterypowered and radio-equipped, and are currently about 120 in3. Common uses for these platforms are in areas such as telematics for automobiles and military and anti-terrorism applications. Such applications are CPU and data intensive and require hardware that consumes roughly as much energy as a laptop PC, but can incorporate sophisticated sensing and signal analysis. A popular ad-hoc, mobile node is Sensoria Corporation’s Linux-based “sGate” [45]. The sGate weighs about 3 pounds without batteries, incorporates a 300 Mhz processor, 64 MB of RAM and has draws of 10 watts power, on average (versus about 40 watts for a typical laptop.) It can be battery powered for “up to 24 hours” using batteries that weigh several pounds. It includes a 10 or 100 mW 2.4 Ghz radio. Though there are a number of interesting ad-hoc network issues presented by these kinds of mobile nodes, mobile databases have been a popular research topic since the early nineties [30, 1]; the research issues associated with querying these ad-hoc network gateways are similar
