In this section, we report on some results from a preliminary
performance evaluation of our location tracking sensor
network. We use packet-level simulation to explore, in
some detail, the implications of some of our design choices.
This section describes our methodology, compares the performance
of diffusion against some idealized schemes, then
explores impact of network dynamics on simulation.
