SRTs provide an ef?cient mechanism for disseminating queries and collecting query results for queries over constant attributes. For attributes that are highly correlated amongst neighbors in the routing tree (e.g. location), SRTs can reduce the number of nodes that must disseminate queries and forward the continuous stream of results from children by nearly an order of magnitude.
