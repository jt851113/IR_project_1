Given a d-dimensional space D = {D1,D2,···,Dd}, we use S to denote a set of objects on space D. Forp ? S, p.Di represent the i-th dimension value. For the simplicity, we assume there is no same value in the same dimension. De?nition 1 k-dominate. An object p is said to kdominate q, if and only if ?D ? D, |D| = k, ?Di ? D, p.Di ? q.Di and ?Dj ? D, p.Dj > q.D j, denoted as p ?k q. De?nition 2 k-dominant skyline. An objectp is a k-dominant skyline object, if and only if ?q ? S\{p}, q ?k p. We use DSKY (k,S,D) to denote the set of allk-dominant skyline object in S on D. Please note that when k = d, k-dominant skyline and conventional skyline have the same semantics. Property 1 If p,q ? S and p ?k+1 q, thenp ?k q. Proof If p ?k+1 q, ?D ? D satis?es De?nition 1, we pick k dimensions from D to form D, since we have assumed above no equivalent values exist in the same dimension among objects, ?D ? D satis?es De?nition 1, i.e. p ?k q. Property 2 If p ? DSKY (k,S,D), then p ? DSKY (k+ 1,S,D). Proof If p ? DSKY (k +1,S,D), then ?q ? S, q ?k+1 p. From Property 1, q ?k p, contradicting with p ? DSKY (k,S,D). Property 3 DSKY (k,S,D)|?|DSKY (k +1,S,D)|. Example 1 Consider the servers database S shown in Table 1(a), where D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, andD6 denote the service quality, the available capacity, the waiting queue length, the failure ratio, the transfer speed, and the cost, respectively. Without the loss of generality, we assume the bigger the value of each indicator, the better (simply use negative representation for indicators D3?6). A skyline query on this example simply retrieves {p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6} as the answer. Obviously, it is helpless to return all servers to the agent as the best choices. Table 1(b) gives the answers ofk-dominant skyline query performed on the same example with varying parameter k. Undoubtedly, k-dominant skyline query with an appropriate k is preferable than conventional skyline query in high dimensional space.
Please note that conventional skyline maintains transitivity and anti-symmetry, neither of which is guaranteed in kdominant skyline. To see this, in Table 1, p3 3-dominates p6, p6 3-dominates p1, while p3 does not 3-dominate p1 and p6 3-dominates p3, but at the same time p3 3-dominates p6. So algorithms introduced for ?nding the conventional skyline are not easily adapted for ?nding k-dominant skyline.
