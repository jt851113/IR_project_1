Figure 6 shows the results of communication cost which
includes query traffic, result data traffic, index dissemination
traffic and traffic incurred by incentive mechanism. The proposed
IA approach significantly outperforms the other two
competitors. Both Eureka and IA approach use indexes to
maintain some useful information. However, Eureka incurs
much more communication traffic than IA does, because of
its inefficient index dissemination. It delivers updated index
values to all neighbors whenever an update happens. When
a neighbor receives this message, it updates its corresponding
index value and recursively delivers the new updated
value to its neighbors. Thus, every update in Eureka may
involve all the nodes in the network. This is the main reason
why Eureka incurs as much as or even higher communication
traffic than the pure flooding approach does. In the IA
approach, the indexes can be renewed during query process.
A node sends the updated indexes to its neighbors in a fixed
time interval, which does not incur recursive effort.
