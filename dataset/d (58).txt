To test the efficiency of our improved local repair algorithm,
we ran a simple aggregate query which computes
the average over all sensor readings every 10 seconds.
In this experiment, 200 sensors are randomly
distributed in a 500m*500m area. (For other experiments
the numbers were qualitatively similar.) We

introduced random link failures quantified as the percentage
of crashed links in a round, and we tested their
influence on the routing protocols. Figure 7 shows the
comparison between AODV and AODV with our improved
local repair algorithm using different link failure
rates. As the link failure rate increases, AODV
uses much more energy than the algorithm with improved
local repair.
We evaluated bunch repair experimentally using the
Cornell campus as the query region. About 150 sensors
are virtually distributed close to buildings or along
main streets; see Figure 9. Figure 8 compares the improved
version of AODV with and without bunch repair.
The threshold to active route reinitialization is
to 80 percent of the tuples. The two algorithms are
very close when link failure ratio is low, but our new
algorithm saves much energy after the failure ratio becomes
larger. This is because bunch repair generates
much fewer route request and reply messages, especially
when more links fail simultaneously.
Figure 10 shows the influence of bunch repair on the
final result accuracy.7 If several local repairs fail a serious
topology change happens, and thus many nodes
are disconnected temporarily. A bunch repair will be
automatically activated in this case, and thus the accuracy
of AODV with bunch repair does not decrease
compared to AODV while at the same time the average
dissipated energy per node will be much lower
compared to AODV.
