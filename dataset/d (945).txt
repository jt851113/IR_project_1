Limited resource availability
is an inherent property of sensors. Scarce resources
include battery capacity, communications bandwidth, and
CPU cycles. Power is the defining limit: it is always possible
to use a faster processor or a more powerful radio, but
these require more power which often is not available. Current
small battery technology provides about 100mAh of
capacity. This is enough to drive a small Atmel processor,
like the one used in several wireless sensor prototypes, at
full speed for only 3.5 hours. Similarly, the current TRM-
1000 radio, also used in many sensor prototypes, uses about
4 per bit of data transmitted: enough to send just 14MB
of data using such a battery. In practice, the power required
for sending data over the wireless radio is the dominant cost
[19], so it is often worth spending many CPU cycles to conserve
just a few bytes of radio traffic
