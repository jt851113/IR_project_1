Acquisitional query processing provides a framework for addressing issues of when, where, and how often data is sampled and which data is delivered in distributed, emdedded sensing environments. Although other research has identi?ed the opportunities for query processing in sensor networks, this work is the ?rst to discuss these fundamental issues in an acquisitional framework.
We identi?ed several opportunities for future research. We are currently actively pursuing two of these: ?rst, we are exploring how query optimizer statistics change in acqusitional environments and studying the role of online re-optimization in sample rate and operator orderings in response to bursts of data or unexpected power consumption. Second, we are pursuing more sophisticated priortization schemes, like wavelet analysis, that can capture salient properties of signals other than large changes (as our delta mechanism does) as well as mechanisms to allow users to express their priortization preferences.
We believe that ACQP notions are of critical importance for preserving the longevity and usefulness of any deployment of battery powered sensing devices, such as those that are now appearing in biological preserves, roads, businesses, and homes. Without appropriate query languages, optimization models, and query dissemination and data delivery schemes that are cognisant of semantics and the costs and capabilities of the underlying harware the success of such deployments will be limited.
