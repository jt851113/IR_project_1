The TAG and TeleTiny architectures combine elements of databases and networking to efficiently process
queries in the sensor network. Literature on active networks [45] discusses the idea that the network could
simultaneously route and transform data, rather than simply serving as an end-to-end data conduit. Within
the sensor network community, work on networks that perform data analysis has been largely confined to the
USC/ISI and UCLA communities. Their work on directed diffusion [21] discusses techniques for moving specific
pieces of information from one place in a network to another, and proposes aggregation-like operations that
nodes may perform as data flows through them. Heidemann et al. [18] propose a scheme for imposing names
onto related groups of sensors in a network, in much the way that our scheme partitions sensor networks into
groups. These papers recognize that aggregation dramatically reduces the amount of data routed through the
network but are focused on application specific solutions that, unlike the approach in TAG, are not obviously
applicable or efficient in a wide range of environments.
Networking protocols for routing data in wireless networks are very popular within the literature [24, 1, 15],
however, none of them address higher level issues of data processing, merely techniques for data routing. Our
tree-based routing approach is clearly inferior to these approaches for peer to peer routing, but works well for
the aggregation scenarios we are focusing on.
Given this overview of related work, the remainder of this paper is devoted to a discussion of the remaining
elements of the TeleTiny system that remain to be built and studied and a brief timeline outlining the completion
of these projects and my dissertation.
