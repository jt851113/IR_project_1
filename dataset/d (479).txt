3.3 Candidate Pattern Generation After all these MIG
counters have been gathered, for each position of a period (of
length ), we keep all events with positive MIG as the candidate
events for this position as shown in Figure 7(b). The candidate
complex patterns10 of period  can be generated iteratively. A
pattern        is constructed each time by assigning
each position  either an event in the corresponding candidate
event set or eternal event. Let "  is the MIG count for
the singular pattern            with  at the th position.
If  "  
 , this pattern will be taken as a candidate
pattern to the verification process presented later in this
section. Otherwise, this generated pattern is simply discarded
since it is impossible for this pattern to meet the generalized information
gain threshold . For example, Figure 7(c) shows the
set of candidate patterns generated from the candidate events in
Figure 7(b) with the threshold   .
