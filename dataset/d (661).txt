der to analyze the use of multiple paths we now make a
stronger assumption about the routing topology. Start-
ing with the leaves at level 0, we assume that each node
at level i has exactly d neighbors within its broadcast
radius at level i + 1, for all 0  i  h  1. From these
neighbors, each node selects k  d of these nodes as its
parents, where k is a fault-resilience parameter, and it
transmits its aggregate value to all k of these nodes.We
use the pessimistic simplication that only one copy of
a leaf's value reaches a level; while somewhat tighter
bounds can be obtained, it suAces to provide close
agreement with our experimental results. Let Ei de-
note the event that a copy of the leaf's value reached
level i conditioned on the value having reached level
i + 1. With leaves at level h, these events are well-
dened for levels 1; 2 : : :. Clearly Pr[Ei]  ()
(from the above simplication), and thus the overall
probability of a message successfully reaching the root
is i Pr[Ei]  ()h. Using the same argument
for the other levels of the tree we can get the follow-
ing: E(count) For
k = 2, p = 0:1 and h = 10 we get E(count)  0:9n,
where n is the total number of nodes. For k = 3 the
bound is close to 0:99n, thus we have only a 1% degra-
dation in the set of reporting sensors.
