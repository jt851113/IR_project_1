To study the impact of network dynamics on the greedy aggregation and the opportunistic aggregation, we simulated node failures as follows. For each sensor field, we repeatedly turned off 20% of nodes for 30 seconds. These nodes were uniformly chosen from the sensor field. Our dynamics experiment imposes fairly adverse conditions for a data dissemination protocol. At any instant, 20% of the nodes in the network are unusable. Furthermore, we do not permit any “settling time” between node failures.
As expected, node failures adversely impact the event delivery ratio of the greedy aggregation more than that of the opportunistic aggregation in the low-density networks (Figure 6(c)). With the network density increases, the size of the opportunistic tree increases due to less path sharing whereas the size of the greedy tree approximately remains the same. It is likely that there are more node failures on the opportunistic tree than the greedy tree. Therefore, the event delivery ratio of the greedy aggregation is higher than that of the opportunistic aggregation for high-density networks. This lower event delivery ratio of the opportunistic aggregation also results in its higher dissipated energy
per event received (Figure 6(a)).
