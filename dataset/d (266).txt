Consider k sources, S1 through Sk and a sink D. Let the network graph G = (V,E) consist of all the nodes V , with E consisting of edges between nodes that can communicate with each other directly. With the assumption that the number of transmissions from any node in the data aggregation tree is exactly one, the following result holds: Result 1: The optimum number of transmissions required per datum for the DC protocol is equal to the number of edges in the minimum Steiner tree in the network which contains the node set (S1,...Sk,D). Hence, assuming an arbitrary placement of sources and a general network graph G, the task of doing DC routing with optimal data aggregation is NP-hard. We examine three generally suboptimal schemes in this paper:
1. Center at Nearest Source (CNS): In this data aggregation scheme, all sources send their data directly to the source which is nearest the sink which sends the the aggregated information on to the sink. 2. Shortest Paths Tree (SPT) : In this data aggregation scheme, each source sends its information to the sink along the shortest path between the two, and overlapping paths are combined to form the aggregation tree. 3. Greedy Incremental Tree (GIT) : This is a sequential scheme: at the ?rst step the aggregation tree consists of only the shortest path between the sink and the nearest source. At each step after that the next source closest to the current tree is connected to the tree1.
