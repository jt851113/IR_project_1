We ran two experiments using the setup described in sec-
tion 4.1.2 (g 11). The duration of each experiment was half
an hour. During the experiments, the sensor-motes and the
base-station mote operated in \PREMON mode" (case# 3
below). The table 27 presents the summary of the results
averaged over both the runs. Given the preliminary nature
of the experiments, the results hold a qualitative signicance
rather than a quantitative one.
Although the motes operated in PREMON mode during the
experiment, we collected enough data to determine their en-
ergy consumption for each of the following three cases:

1. Case#1: All sensor-motes operate in update mode: In
this case, the sensor-motes transmit their readings pe-
7Sensors in the experimental setup (g 11) were assigned
addresses: 4, 8, 12, and 14, from left-to-right

riodically (once every second). The base station does
not transmit any prediction.
2. Case#2: Base-station mote generates only constant-
value predictions: In this case, while the sensor-motes
operate in \PREMON mode", the base-station mote
transmits only constant-value predictions. We con-
sider this case in order to determine the incremental
gain of generating movement predictions.
3. Case#3: Base-station mote generates both constant-
value and movement predictions: In this case, all the
motes (sensor-motes and the base-station mote) oper-
ate in \PREMON mode", and follow the techniques
presented in this paper.
The summary of results for each of the three cases appear in
gure 9. The graph in the gure shows the ratio of energy
consumption in case#1 to that in case#2 and case#3.
The energy consumed in the Mote for each of the basic op-
erations is listed in table 18. In all the calculations below,
we assume that there are no packet losses.
