Definition 2.6 Given a pattern P with period and a se-
quence D of N (N>=1)events: d1,d2,....,dN, the 
support of P within D is the number of subsequences
that support P.
Intuitively, the event sequence can be viewed as a list of
segments, each of which consists of  contiguous events. There
would be full segments, among which the segment that
matches will count for the support of P.
