So far, we have only discussed two aggregates,
COUNT and SUM. These techniques can also be ex-
tended to other aggregate functions beyond summation
and counting. For example, AVG can also be com-
puted directly from COUNT and SUM sketches.
The second moment can be computed as an aver-
age of the squares of the items, and then combined
with the average of the items, to compute the vari-
ance and standard deviation. Finally, we note that
the sketches themselves are easily generalized to han-
dle other data types such as xed point and signed
numbers, and to a certain extent, products (sum-
ming logarithms) and oating point.
