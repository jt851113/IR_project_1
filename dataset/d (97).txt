Next, we define some baselines that the advanced query
routing strategies can be compared to:
‧ Random: Rank peers in random order.
‧ By size: instead of creating a content-related profile for
each peer, just rank peers by the number of documents
they hold.
‧ Base CORI: apply the procedure described in the previous
section, refining neither queries nor profiles.
1This is again unknown in a P2PIR setting, but was taken
from the whole collection for the experiments. The effect of
using only a rough estimate for this quantity remains to be
examined in future work.
