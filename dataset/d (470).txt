DEFINITION 2.5. Given a pattern 	         with
period  and a sequence of  events         , the
information loss of  on position  with respect to 	 is the
information of the event  iff  is not in compliance with
	 at position  and there is no information loss otherwise.
The overall information loss of  with respect to 	 is the
summation of the information loss of each position.
  For example, the information loss of     
on position 2 with respect to      is 0 while the
infomation loss on position 5 is   .
