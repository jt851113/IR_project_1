We focus our attention on a single network ?ow that is assumed to consist of a single data sink attempting to gather information from a number of data sources. We start with simple models of routing schemes which use data aggregation (which we term data-centric), and schemes which do not (which we term address-centric). In both cases we assume there are some common elements - the sink ?rst sends out a query/interest for data, the sensor nodes that have the appropriate data then respond with the data. They differ in
the manner the data is sent from the sources to the sink: Address-centric Protocol (AC): Each source independently sends data along the shortest path to sink ( “end-toend routing” ). Data-centric Protocol (DC): The sources send data to the sink, but routing nodes enroute can look at the content of the data and perform aggregation on multiple input packets. We consider in this paper simple aggregation functions (such as duplicate suppression, min, max) in which multiple input packets can be aggregated into a single output packet.
