Our experimental setup consisted of four motion sensors
placed along a busy corridor6 (g 11). Another Mote acts as
the base station. All motion sensors report to the base sta-
tion once every second. Following the PREMON paradigm,
the base station analyzes the readings of the motion sen-
sors and generates predictions about future readings of the
motion sensors. The motion sensors store the predictions
received and transmit their readings only when they do not
match with the predicted values.
