The simplest approach to supporting monitoring in sensor
networks would be to have all the sensors report their sensed
readings to base station whenever it changes. We refer to
this mode of operation of sensors as \update-mode". The
base station collects these updates and sends them to an
access point. Thus, at any point, a base station maintains
the database of current readings of all the sensors in its cell.
Also, the access points collectively maintain a database of
current readings of all the sensors in the sensor eld. Users
interested in monitoring the sensor eld may register their
interest with the appropriate access points [10]. We refer to
this as the centralized approach.
