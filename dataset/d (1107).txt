In this section, we discuss some recent development aiming
at handling noises in the form of injection. Periodicity
detection on sequence data is a challenging problem of
great importance in many real applications. Two models,
namely asynchronous patterns [16] and meta patterns [17],
are proposed recently to address the issues of accommodating
insertion of random noise and characterizing change of
behavior.
