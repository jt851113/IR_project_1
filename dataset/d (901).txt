Consider a set of objects moving through a certain region of
interest, where a number of short-range wireless sensors has
been deployed for detection purposes. The distributed tracking
problem we are interested in solving is about communicating
the locations of the detected objects from the sensors to a querying
point, where the information is further utilized by the
user.
