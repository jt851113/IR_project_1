By using X, we progressively output k-dominant skyline objects as follows. We
scan X to compare each object p ? X against the first object q. In the scan
procedure, objects that are k-dominated by the first object are removed from X.
During the procedure, if the first object q is k-dominated by any other objects
p ? X, we remove q from X and stop the scanning procedure. If q is not
removed in the scanning procedure, then output q as a k-dominant object and
remove q from X. We repeat this scanning procedure until X becomes empty.
Applying the k-dominant check with k = 5 for Table 3, we note that in
the first scan N5, N3, N8, N1 and N6 are 5-dominated by the first object, N2.
Therefore, those dominated objects are removed from X. On the other hand, N2
is not 5-dominated by any other notebooks. So, after the first scan, our method
outputs N2 as a 5-dominant skyline object and then remove N2 from X. In the
second scan, N4 becomes the first object and it 5-dominates N7. So, we remove
N7 and outputs N4 as a 5-dominant skyline object. Similarly, if we apply k = 4
for the same database X, then our Sort-Filtering method returns only N2 as a
4-dominant skyline object.
