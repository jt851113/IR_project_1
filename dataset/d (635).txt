We have shown so far how default values can be maintained
in the data updating process to ensure invariance
(1). We also fixed the error bounds for each node so
that invariance (2) also holds. But this may not be costefficient,
since different source sensors may exhibit different
types of behavior. For those sensors whose values
do not change very much, it is beneficial to assign them
smaller error tolerances and assign the slack saved this
way to other more active sensor nodes. We exploit this
insight to design an approximate algorithm to adaptively
adjust the error tolerance at each node in order to achieve
an overall balance on communication activity by allowing
sensor nodes update at similar frequencies.
On the other hand, balanced workloads may also result
in reduced overall workload, although optimality is
not guaranteed due to the unknown nature of data behavior.
Figure 3 shows one case that can illustrate the benefit
of having balanced workload. Assume data readings of
the two sensor nodes in different rounds are within some
ranges (r1 and r2). And assume the total error tolerance
allowed is also the same (d1 + d2 = d0
1 + d0
2). It is obvious
that the distribution in figure 3(a) will generate some
messages while the distribution in figure 3(b) will not.
