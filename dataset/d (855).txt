In this paper, we described the directed diffusion paradigm
for designing distributed sensing algorithms. There are several
lessons we can draw from our preliminary evaluation of
diffusion. First, directed diffusion has the potential for significartt
energy efficiency. Even with relatively unoptimized
path selection, it outperforms an idealized traditional data
dissemination scheme like omniscient multicast. Second, dif-
fusion mechanisms are stable under the ranges of network
dynamics considered in this paper. Finally, for directed diffusion
to achieve its full potential, however, careful attention
has to be paid to the design of sensor radio MAC layers.
Directed diffusion has some novel features--data-centric dissemination,
reinforcement-based adaptation to the empirically
best path, and in-network data aggregation and caching.
To our knowledge, no previous networking work has designed
and evaluated a data distribution mechanism incorporating
these features. There is a good reason for this--
these features may not be justifiable in the context of traditional
networks. However, as we show here, these features
can enable highly energy-efficient and robust dissemination
in dynamic sensor networks, while at the same time minimizing
the per-node configuration that is characteristic of
today's networks.
As we have emphasized before, this work represents an initim
foray into the design of diffusion mechanisms. Our
remote surveillance network represents a non-trivial exploration
of this design space. Even for this network, we have
not explored the entire space of alternative designs. To draw
a simple analogy, we are with sensor networks where we were
with the Internet about 3 decades ago.
