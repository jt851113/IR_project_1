Assume that a query Q consisting of M sub-queries is at a sensor x. If d is the look-ahead,
then sensor x will have information about the values stored by f(d) sensors. Thus, x can
resolve at most min(f(d),M) out of the M sub-queries. In the worst case, x cannot resolve
any of the M sub-queries. After resolving the possible queries, x will forward the remaining
query Q0  Q to a sensor which is chosen uniformly at random from those exactly d hops
away. Assuming that whenever a sensor gets the query, it can always get information from
f(d) new nodes (i.e. there are no loops in the query forwarding process and the topology of
the network is regular), the probability of answering K0 of the M sub-queries is dependent
only on the information obtained from the f(d) nodes. This characteristic of the query
Figure 13: Markov Chain with states representing the number of unresolved sub-queries of an
active query. Transitions are only to lower-valued states at most min(f(d),M) to the right, and
the chain terminates at the absorbing state 0 when all sub-queries have been resolved.
forwarding process naturally lends itself to be modelled as a Markov Chain, as shown in
figure 13.
The states of this Markov Chain are the number of unresolved sub-queries at any instant.
Thus, given a query consisting of M sub queries, the states of the Markov Chain are M,M?
1,M?2, ...0. State 0 is the absorption state. This Markov Chain has certain characteristics:
1. There is no transition from state M0 to M00 where M0 < M00
2. From a state M0, there can be no transition to a state M00 where M0 ?M00 > f(d)
The Markov Chain formulation is useful in that once the transition probabilities between the
various states are known, the mean time to absorption (i.e. SM) can be easily calculated.
Our next step is to find the transition probabilities of the Markov Chain.
