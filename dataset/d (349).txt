A query initiated by a peer PQ eventually reaches a super-peer
(i.e., SON). The super-peer first determines the subset of its peers
that can provide results relevant to the query. Then the query is
forwarded to these peers. Each peer will process the query locally
and if it has matching results these will be returned to the super-
peer. These results must be merged into a top-k list of documents
that will be the result of this super-peer.
In order to support this set of operations, a super-peer must perform
two main tasks: peer selection and result merging. As already
mentioned, a super-peer maintains an index over its peersâ€™
features. Essentially the super-peer has enough information to decide
for each peer whether it contains relevant documents to the
query. Therefore, when the query is processed by the super-peer,
it is forwarded only to a selected set of peers that may contribute
results to the final result set. Then each peer returns a list (of maximum
length k) of documents and their scores respectively. The
super-peer merges this information into a final top-k list of documents
with highest scores with respect to the query. This top-k list
is the final result of the particular SON for the given query.
