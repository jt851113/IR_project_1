The prior sections described fairly mature technologies. RFID tags represent the low end of emerging sensor deployments, in terms of both technology and cost. RFID tags are small enough to embed in a standard price tag, and cost only pennies per unit. An RFID tag is capable of transmitting a value (e.g. an ID) and perhaps computing a handful of instructions (e.g. decrement a counter) when brought in proximity to an RFID reader. By contrast, RFID readers are much more expensive (currently from hundreds to thousands of dollars, though prices are falling) and they require signi?cant power to run. Hence RFID readers are typically immobile, connected to a ?xed power source. RFID is already in use in a number of applications, including highway toll systems and asset tracking for supply chain and retail applications. Because RFID is low-tech and already quite inexpensive, it is likely to be a source of “buzz” in the short run. However, the requirement of physical proximity to a reader makes RFID a fairly limited technology; it is essentially one step more sophisticated than bar-codes. The re?nements offered by RFID are likely to increase database insertion rates beyond what is seen in high-end retail data warehousing.
