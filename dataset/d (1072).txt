We use both synthetic datasets and real datasets in the experiments. The generation
of the synthetic datasets is controlled by three parameters, dimension
number n, data size Size and distribution Dist. There are three optional distributions
in the synthetic data sets: Correlated, Independent and Anti-Correlated.
Table 4 shows the number of the k-dominant skyline objects on 15-dimensional
data set with 100k objects on different distributions and different constraint
parameter k.
When k is close to the dimension size, the number of k-dominant skyline
objects in the anti-correlated dataset becomes much larger than that of the
independent and correlated datasets. However, when k is small, the correlated
dataset can still have some dominant skyline objects, while no dominant skyline
objects can be found on the other two distributions.
We also examine the performance for a real dataset. We used the NBA statistics.
This dataset contains 17000 players season records on 17 attributes from
the first season of NBA in 1945. Every records contain the statistical value
of a playerâ€™s performance in one season, such as game played(GP), field goal
made(FGM), total assists(AST) and so on. One player may have several records
if he played in NBA for more than one season.
