We consider the energy consumption of battery while nodes
are forwarding the queries or updating IA values. Suppose
ei is the energy cost of node i for one-hop connection. As we
know a mobile device can be configured with several power
levels at which it can send packets. Different power levels
lead to different reachable ranges. To simplify our model,
we let p to be a standard power level in our network. Each
node sends messages at power level p and consequently has
the same reachable range. In general, the energy cost ei of
sending a data unit by node i is
where σi is a battery state parameter. Here σi reflects node
i’s internal states such as remaining electric energy of the
battery and the valuation of each unit of power.
We distinguish two cases in explaining the energy cost
during query routing:
‧ If node i is not on the query routing path, then ei = 0.
‧ If node i is on the query routing path, then whenever
node i forwards a data unit of query request or query
result at power level p, the corresponding cost ei is pσi.
On the other hand, the receiving energy cost of a node i for
a data unit is a fixed value ri. We now consider energy cost of
different roles in the network. For an arbitrary intermediate
node Eitm, it receives and forwards the message twice in
both query propagation process and result delivery process.
Therefore, the energy cost is
For an issuer node Eisr or a resource provider node Ersp,
it only receives and forwards the message once. Thus, the
energy cost is
For a node who updates its IA value to its ni neighbors.
The energy cost Eupd is
