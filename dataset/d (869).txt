In the simulated environment, over a certain time period T, one object traverses the network and generates a sequence of events. In addition, the independent false event processes at each node generate unrelated events. The nodes in the network execute the algorithm described above and report back any confirmed detections. A true detection occurs if the node, which it originates from, contains the object within its sensing radius. Any additional detection reported is considered a false detection.
The network and object parameters are the same as those in the previous simulations. The duration is set T=10 minutes. The object starts its transition at unknown position [5,5] during this time. The broadcast radius is R=30m, hypotheses expire after τ =20s, the similarity distance is δ =5, and the gating region is governed by ?=4. 50 simulations were executed and the results were averaged. Figure 7a below displays the level false detections per simulation, as we vary the level of unrelated events with p and the convergence criterion with c. Figure 7b displays the object detection rate for the same range of parameters.
It is noted that the number of false detections reported decreases exponentially as the convergence criterion c is increased. In addition the number of false detections reported increases exponentially with p. The object detection rate does not appear to be affected greatly by p, but decreases linearly with c. This is because the pruning procedure causes some true hypotheses to be eliminated, and this becomes more likely as the required length of the sequences increases (it is noted the average object created a sequence of 14 events as it crossed the network). A detailed examination of how the pruning parameters (R, τ, δ, ?) affect the results in beyond the scope of this paper.
