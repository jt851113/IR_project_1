In this section we report a performance study which
compares the performance of the periodicity mining algorithms
proposed in this paper. In particular, we give a performance
comparison between the single-period Apriori
algorithm (Algorithm 3.1) (or simply called Apriori), and
the max-subpattern hit-set algorithm (Algorithm 3.2) (or
simply hit-set) applied to a single period.
This comparison indicates that there is a significant
gain in efficiency by max-subpattern hit-set over Apriori.
Since there is more gain when applied to multiple periods
by using max-subpattern hit-set, it is clear that
max-subpattern hit-set is the winner.
The performance study is conducted on a Pentium 166
machine with 64 megabytes main memory, running inWindows/
NT. The program is written in Microsoft/VisualC++.
