After discovering the single patterns, valid subsequences of
dierent symbols may be combined to form a valid subse-
quence of multiple symbols of the same period. We employ
a level-wise search algorithm, which generates the subse-
quences of i-patterns based on valid subsequences of (i??1)-
patterns with the same period length. To eciently prune
the search space, we use two properties:

 Symbol property. If a pattern P is valid, then all of
its generalizations are valid.

 Segment property. If D0 = dj; dj+1; dj+2; : : : ; dk is
a valid segment for pattern P, then D0 is also a valid
segment of all generalizations of P.

Since these two properties are straightforward, we omit the
proof. Based on these properties, we can prune the candi-
dates of a valid pattern eciently. For example, if two pat-
terns (d1; ; ; ) and (d2; ; ; ) are valid, then three candi-
date 2-patterns can be generated: (d1; d2; ; ), (d1; ; d2; )
and (d1; ; ; d2). Similarly, (d1; d2; d3; ) can become a can-
didate 3-pattern only if (d1; d2; ; ), (d1; ; d3; ), and (d2; d3;
; ) are all valid. After the candidate set of valid i-patterns
is generated, then a similar algorithm to the SB algorithm is
executed to verify whether these candidates are indeed valid
patterns. The SB algorithm also nds the valid subsequence
with the most repetitions for each valid pattern.
