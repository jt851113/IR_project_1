The goal of computing k-dominant skyline points is to reduce
the number of interesting points returned by the skyline
operator. However, the number of dominant skyline points
can still be large when k is not sufficiently small. On the
other hand, if k is too small, no (or too few) k-dominant
skyline points may be returned. To avoid the difficulty of
choosing the right value of k, we consider instead computing
top-δ dominant skyline queries, which are queries to find the
smallest k such that there are at least δ number of dominant
skyline points .
In this section, we describe how to extend the dominant
skyline algorithms in the previous section to evaluate top-
δ dominant skyline queries. The input parameters to each
algorithm are D, S, and δ (instead of k).
Given two points p and p, we use maxDom(p, p) to denote
the largest value k ? [0, |S|] such that p k-dominates
p.
