In this paper, a framework for distributed tracking and detection in sparse sensor networks is presented. Discrete detected events occurring in the network are associated together on a local basis using a decentralized hypothesis propagation algorithm. Confirmed objects may be reported once a suitable confidence criteria has been reached. Only a single short-range broadcast is required when an event occurs. Long-range broadcasts only occur after a confirmed detection occurs. The power savings over a centralized detection algorithm become significant when the number of events is much greater than the number of confirmed detections.
In future work, a more rigorous probabilistic framework will be developed, incorporating known object and false event densities. The decision process at each node will be explicitly modeled and will take into account soft decisions. Fully-fledged distributed continuous tracking of targets in such networks will be explored. It is also hoped to implement some of the proposed algorithms in a working sensor network.
