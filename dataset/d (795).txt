Figure 4 shows the running times for the interleaved and
sequential algorithms for various noise levels. (Since the
interleaved algorithm is relatively unaffected by noise, we
only show its running times for support 5% to keep the
graph more readable.)
Noise influences the data generated in two ways. One,
the number of itemsets that do not lead to cycles goes up as
the noise level increases. Two, as the amount of noise in the
data increases, it leads to spurious cycles, where an itemset
is used for data generation in a cyclic fashion accidentally
as dictated by the noise parameter.
As can be seen from the graph, the interleaved algorithm
is relatively unaffected by noise. (The curves are quite horizontal
for supports of  33% and  25% also.) However,
the sequential algorithm shows more interesting behavior.
The graphs of the running time increase more or less linearly
with noise, but the slope of the graphs is different at
different support levels. The explanation for this lies in the
number of new itemsets added by noise. At high support
levels, noise does not add many itemsets. (If the transaction
size is  , large itemset size is

5% in the data.) Therefore,
for high support levels, the slope of the sequential
algorithm rises slowly. At low support levels, noise tends
to have a much more dramatic impact on the amount of
wasted work performed by the sequential algorithm and its
running time rises with a much steeper slope.
