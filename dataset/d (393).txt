Figure 6 shows that the impact of moving speed on
energy consumption for scheme CM and PES with
INSTANT prediction heuristic. We do have the result
for the missing rate with various moving speed as
well but omit it due to the limited space. The figure
shows that the energy consumption increases linearly
as the objectsâ€™ moving speed increases. In addition,
the missing rate also increases linearly (not shown
here). This is because the faster an object moves, the
more target nodes need to be waken up (for ROUTE
and ALL NBR). In addition, the destination node is
farer away from the current node and thus more difficult
to predict. As shown in the figure, when the speed
is under 25 m/second, all three of wake up heuristics
are able to achieve energy savings compared with CM.
Among the three PES schemes, the ALL NBR has a
higher energy consumption but a much lower missing
rate than the other two. ROUTE outperforms
DESTINATION in terms of both energy consumption
and missing rate. This is because the overhead incurred
by waking up more (target) nodes in heuristic
ROUTE is still less than the energy overhead for relocating
the object in heuristic DESTINATION. This
fact indicates that ROUTE is a good choice for monitoring
high-speed moving objects by balancing energy
consumption and object missing.
