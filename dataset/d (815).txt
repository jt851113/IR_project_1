We have performed an evaluation of the fusion and placement
modules of the DFuse architecture at two different levels:
micro-benchmarks to quantify the overhead of the primitive operations
of the fusion API including channel creation, attachments/
detachments, migration, and I/O; ability of the placement
module to optimize the network given a cost function.
The experimental setup uses a set of wireless iPAQ 3870s running
Linux “familiar” distribution version 0.6.1 together with
a prototype implementation of the fusion module discussed in
section 5.1.
