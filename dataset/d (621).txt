In Section III, we have allowed only one level of clustering;
we now extend the algorithm to allow more than one level of
clustering. Assume that there are h levels in the clustering
hierarchy with level 1 being the lowest level and level h being
the highest. In this clustered environment, the sensors
communicate the gathered data to level-1 clusterheads (CHs).
The level-1 CHs aggregate this data and communicate the
aggregated data or estimates based on the aggregated data to
level-2 CHs and so on. Finally, the level-h CHs communicate
the aggregated data or estimates based on this aggregated data
to the processing center. The cost of communicating the
information from the sensors to the processing center is the
energy spent by the sensors to communicate the information to
level-1 clusterheads (CHs), plus the energy spent by the level-1
CHs to communicate the aggregated information to level-2
CHs, â€¦, plus the energy spent by the level-h CHs to
communicate the aggregated information to the information
processing center.
