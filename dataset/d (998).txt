In this section we combine content analysis using traditional
Information Retrieval techniques with improved
connectivity analysis to tackle topic drift. There are two
basic approaches both assuming we can determine the
relevance of a node to the query topic: (i) eliminating
non-relevant nodes from the graph, and (ii) regulating
the inuence of a node based on its relevance. We have
also experimented with combinations of these techniques.
These mostly address problem 3 since they discard or penalize
nodes that do not belong to the topic. However,
in practice they also seem to solve problem 2, since automatically
generated links often point to pages outside
the topic.
