Definition 2.11 Given a set of complementary patterns
of the same period, the minimum common superpattern
(MCSP) of is the pattern of period, which satisfies the
following two conditions.

Each pattern in  is a subpattern of.
There does not exist a subpattern of such
that each pattern in  is also a subpattern of.

  It follows from the definition that the information of the
MCSP of a set,  , of complementary patterns is the summation
of the information of each pattern in.
  For a given event segment and a set,
,of complementary patterns, the information loss of with
respect to the MCSP of  satisfies the following equality

where is the information loss of with respect to.
The rationale is that if is not in compliance with a pattern
in on position, then the th position must be instantiated
and must not be in compliance with the MCSP of  on
position either. In general, for any event sequence, the
overall information loss of with respect to the MCSP of a
set of complementary patterns is equal to the summation of
the information loss of with respect to each pattern in  .
