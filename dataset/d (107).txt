In this section, we will study the question whether query
expansion can improve peer rankings. To that end, we expand
queries using the three strategies discussed in section
3.3 and use the expanded queries with the CORI selection
algorithm to obtain a peer ranking. Expansion is only used
for ranking peers, not for retrieving and ranking documents.
This means that the scores of documents remain the same
as in the experiments above.
Table 3 shows the effectiveness of expanded queries as
compared to that of unexpanded ones for Ohsumed. This
is done by analysing performance within the first 15 peers
visited and giving all intervals M where expanded queries
perform significantly better than unexpanded ones and all
intervals M'where they perform significantly worse.
The picture for Ohsumed and GIRT (which is not shown
here) is rather unclear. However, there are rather few cases
in which expanded queries are actually significantly better
than unexpanded ones. We also see that – when we concentrate
on the very first peer in the ranking – virtually all
query expansion methods fail to produce better results than
the CORI baseline, in fact most of them are significantly
worse. For Citeseer, the situation is easier to interpret:
global pseudo feedback improves over unexpanded queries,
but the other two expansion strategies are detrimental in all
ranges.
All in all, query expansion seems a dangerous – instead of
a helpful – tool when applied to ranking peers w.r.t. queries,
regardless of whether we use global (from the web) or local
information in the expansion process.
