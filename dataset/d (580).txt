For both ERS and FBQ, we use the same simulation setup as ACQUIRE. For both these
mechanisms, we simulate 100 different runs. Each run consists of 1000 queries each containing
20 sub-queries. In each run, we use the query-files, grid-files and same values of c described
in section 7.2.
Figure 10: Comparison of ACQUIRE, ERS, ACQUIRE with d = 0 and FBQ by simulations
(N = 100, M = 20) with energy costs on a log scale (left) and on a linear scale (right).
Compare with theoretical curves in figure 6.
As figure 10 shows, FBQ has the worst energy consumption in comparison with the other
approaches. This concurs with the analytical curves in figure 6. ACQUIRE with d = 0
(random walk) incurs a greater energy consumption as compared to ACQUIRE with d = 1
as well as ERS, while the analytical curves show that at high values of c, ACQUIRE with
d = 0 is better than ERS.This disrepancy is because of the loops in the query trajectory
in the case of random walk as was mentioned in section 7.1. However, the energy savings of
ACQUIRE over ERS seem to be similar to that shown by the analytical curves in figure 6.
