The skyline operator has been used as an effective mechanism
to identify “dominating” points in a multi-dimensional
data set. Unfortunately, as the dimensionality of the data
set grows, the skyline operator begins to lose its discriminating
power and returns a large fraction of the data. In this
paper, we proposed a generalization of the skyline concept,
called k-dominant skyline, to overcome this difficulty. We
presented three different algorithms to solve the k-dominant
skyline problem. We defined notions of a top-δ dominant
skyline query and a weighted (dominant) skyline query, and
showed how the three algorithms for the k-dominant skyline
problem could be extended to address these problems
as well. Our experimental results showed that our methods
can find interesting objects in the data set efficiently.
In summary, the notion of k-dominant skylines proposed in
this paper gracefully extends traditional skylines, and leads
to both more meaningful skyline results as well as more efficient
computation.
