Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) are built for processing
and reacting to continuous input data, which also involves
certain data mining tasks. One important task is burst detection. A
burst is defined as an abnormal aggregate in the stream. Usually,
bursts are determined in the context of one or more time windows
moving over the data stream.
Burst detection is used in a lot of application scenarios, like monitoring
facility sensor data, stock trading systems, astrophysics, and
traffic control systems. In all cases we have to handle continuously
streaming data, which requires incremental one-pass algorithms.
Additionally, all the mentioned scenarios claim for detecting bursts
over a variety of dynamically chosen window sizes, rather than over
predefined ones. This is called elastic burst detection [9].
To illustrate the problem of non-stationary stream data, imagine
heat sensors, located in a single living room. A burst is detected by
summing up the single temperatures from the time window of interest
â€“ any resulting sum that is above a given threshold is regarded
as a burst and should result in according reactions. But, we will
observe periods, because temperatures are changing with day and
night hours. Second, especially on hot summer days, the room will
continuously heat up, particularly in the midday hours. These facts
should be involved in triggering actuations like lowering heating
systems or blinds, but this should not result in an alarm just be-
cause the system thinks it detected a burst. Thus, the threshold for
bursts must be adapted with occurring trends and periods. As we
will show, one approach to handle this is to apply techniques from
time series forecasting.
A main feature of our approach is that both, burst detection and
time series forecasting, are implemented in two absolutely independent
operators. Like this, they can be arbitrarily combined with
other operators in a multi-functional DSMS.
