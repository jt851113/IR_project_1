A prototype version of NaigraCQ has been developed, which
includes a Group Optimizer, Continuous Query Manager, Event
Detector, and Data Manager. As the core of our incremental
group optimization, the Group Optimizer currently can
incrementally group selection and join operators. Our
incremental group optimizer is still at a preliminary stage.
However, incremental group optimization has been shown to be
a promising way to achieve good performance and scalability.
We intend to extend incremental group optimization to queries
containing operators other than selection and join. For example,
sharing computation for expensive operators, such as
aggregation, may be very effective. “Dynamic regrouping” is
another interesting future direction that we intend to explore.
