Abstract — Considering bene?ts of di?erent collaborators, cooperative work usually faces the challenge to make a trade-o? decision upon multiple criterions. K-dominant skyline, a novel database query technology, may return appropriate optimal choices and play as a solution. To reduce intensive comparisons between objects in skyline computation, we propose a novel sorting-based algorithm named Sorted cumulative algorithm. Furthermore, to meet the requirement of distributed collaborative environment, we also address Parallel SCA, which accelerates the computation based on some data partitioning techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to con?rm the superior e?ciency of the proposed methods against existing ones, especially in the context of high dimensional datasets. Key words — k-dominant skyline, High dimensional space, Parallelization, Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW).
