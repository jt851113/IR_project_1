4.1 Synthetic Sequence Generation For the purpose of evaluation
of the performance of STAMP, we use four synthetically
generated sequences. Each sequence consists of 1024 distinct
events and 20M occurrences of events. The synthetic sequence
is generated as follows. First, at the beginning of the
sequence, the period length  of the next pattern is determined,
which is geometrical distributed with mean %. The number of
events involved in a pattern is randomly chosen between 1 and
. The number of repetitions  of this pattern is geometrical
distributed with mean %
. The events that are involved in the
pattern are chosen according to a normal distribution with mean

 (there are total 1024 distinct events) and standard deviation
2. However, the pattern may not perfectly repeat itself for
 times. To simulate the imperfectness of the subsequence, we
employ a parameter A to control the noise. A is uniformly distributed
between 0.5 and 1. With probability A, the next  events
match the pattern. Otherwise, the next  events do not support
the pattern. The replacement events are chosen from the event
set with the same normal distribution (mean and standard deviation
equal to 
 and 2, respectively). This subsequence ends
when there are  matches, and a new subsequence for a new
pattern starts. This process repeats until it reaches the end of the
sequence. Four sequences are generated based on values of %
and %
 in Table 1.
