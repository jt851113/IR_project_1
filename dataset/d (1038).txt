As we discussed before, the query distribution plays an important
role in the index selection. In this subsection, we evaluate
PISCES by issuing queries of different distributions. Two metrics
are defined in this experiment. In Figure 9(a), we measure the percentage
of queries that can be directly answered by the index without
JIT data pulling from the individual ERP or database system.
In Figure 9(b), the delay to construct the index is computed (measured
as the interval between the data becoming popular and the
index for the data being constructed) When the query distribution
is highly skewed, about 90% of queries can be directly answered
by the index. Moreover, PISCES is also sensitive to the changing
of query distribution. The new index entries can be incorporated
into the existing index in less than 10 seconds. However, as the
distribution becomes more uniform (θ close to 0), the index cannot
answer most of the queries and it also takes a long time for PISCES
to observe the query distribution.
This indicates that PISCES is most efficient in skewed query distribution.
In real cases, queries often follow some patterns. Figure
10 shows the statistics about the search of AOL [1] from March
2006 to May 2006. The top 5% keywords attract about 60% of total
queries. In Figure 11, we compute the benefit of indexing data
within a cell. The benefit is defined as:
Number of Answered Queries / Indexing Cost
1000k queries following Zipfian distribution with θ = 1 are injected
to the system and we sort the cells by their benefits in descending
order. Figure 11 shows the average benefit of indexing top 1% to
5% cells. The average benefit decreases sharply as more cells are
indexed, which indicates that only the top cells are worth indexing.
