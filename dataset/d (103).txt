The second scenario is a situation where digital libraries
specialised in various subdisciplines are joined together. In
order to evaluate this, two test collections were used, Ohsumed
and the German GIRT-4 collection. In both cases, documents
have classes from a thesaurus-like resource assigned
to them which are identified with peers, i.e. a peer shares all
documents that are classified under the corresponding category.
In case of Ohsumed, the classes are so-called MeSH
terms (Medical Subject Headings), in case of GIRT controlled
terms from a thesaurus for the social sciences.
In the Ohsumed collection, documents have an average
of 10.6 MeSH terms assigned to them (standard deviation is
4.3), in GIRT documents have an average of 10.15 controlled
terms (standard deviation 3.99). The distribution of peer
sizes – when identifying MeSH terms or controlled terms
with peers – again resembles a power law in both cases.
In Ohsumed, there is a total of 14,623 MeSH terms in the
collection, of which only 7,124 havemore than 40 documents.
In GIRT, we have 7,151 distinct controlled terms, with 3,847
having more than 40 documents.
This means that, in both cases, a significant number of
peers will share only few documents. This might seem unrealistic
for a digital library scenario. On second thought,
however, there are also reasons for assuming the contrary:
if we allowed digital libraries to be linked in a peer-to-peer
fashion, it is not unlikely that their sizes would evolve into a
power-law distribution, a phenomenon which is almost ubiquitous
in real-life distributions.
