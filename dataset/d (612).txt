Our demonstration aims at showing an operational
AlvisP2P network where each participant can publish doc-
uments and search for some already available content. To
do so, a large corpus of documents will be published in an
AlvisP2P network running at a number of peers located in
several research institutions such as EPFL and the Univer-
sity of Zagreb. A demonstration machine will be setup to
run one or several AlvisP2P clients, which will be able to
join the running network through the Internet to perform
network wide information retrieval and to index additional
local content.
A second demonstration machine will be setup to illus-
trate the indexing/retrieval mechanisms implemented in our
software. It will also report the current state of the network,
as well as some critical statistics about bandwidth consump-
tion, storage, etc.
The purpose of the demonstration is to let a user interact
with the system to get a more detailed understanding of the
distributed retrieval mechanisms. During the demonstration
it will be possible to switch between the HDK and QDI
approaches at any time, index some new documents, submit
several queries and observe the results obtained using the
distributed index.
