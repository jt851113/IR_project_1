Given that power is one of the fundamental constraints in these networks, it is interesting to consider how power plays into query execution. First of all, because communication is orders of magnitude more expensive than local computation, it is much more ef?cient to move the data processing logic into the network rather than collecting and processing sensor data outside the network. There are two issues here: ?rst, the highlevel, physical operator placement issues regarding where various operators should run to reduce excessive communication and minimize power consumption, and second, the low-level systems issues about how to make operators run ef?ciently and how to schedule computation and communication such that devices use as little energy as possible. There has been some work on operator placement [4], but a number of challenges still remain. Particularly interesting are issues pertaining to heterogeneity â€“ that is, choosing where to place an operator given that the nodes in the network may have differing processing power or battery life, and may be experiencing different computational or communications loads over load. Dealing with dynamic heterogeneity, such as variations in load, suggests some form of adaptive query optimization, such as eddies[2].
