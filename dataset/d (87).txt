This paper experimentally studies approaches to the problem
of ranking information resources w.r.t. user queries in
peer-to-peer information retrieval. In distributed environments,
for each given user query and a set of information resources
that are available, we need to select the right subset
of these resources to forward the query to. Here, we study
the problem of pruning descriptions of resources to acceptable
lengths in a peer-to-peer scenario and two approaches
to overcome the mismatch problem that may arise as a consequence
of the pruning, namely query expansion and learning
better resource descriptions from query streams. The
results show that resource descriptions can be pruned to a
large extent without ill effects and that learning better descriptions
from query streams works much better than query
expansion.
