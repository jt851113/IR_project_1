We start by describing a simple scheme for performing mon-
itoring operations in sensor networks. We then describe
how we may save energy by employing PREMON. Next, we
present the details of the mechanisms based on the PRE-
MON paradigm. Finally, we evaluate these mechanisms
with simple experiments and show their eectiveness.
2we use the words cluster-head and base station interchange-
ably in the paper to refer to the cluster-head
