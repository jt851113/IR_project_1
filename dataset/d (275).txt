We begin by examining a range of sensing scenarios, starting with several more traditional sensing and sensor fusion applications and moving towards the new generation of sensing applications that has arisen with the advent of cheap, low cost sensing hardware and radios. Figure 1 illustrates this spectrum, with the four major areas we discuss shown along it. We begin at the left of the spectrum, with satellites, and then discuss data-loggers, RFID tags, and ?nally, wireless sensor networks, which, as we shall see, lie at a sweet-spot in terms of computational power, cost, and size that make them especially attractive to the database research community.
