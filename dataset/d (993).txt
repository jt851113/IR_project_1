The goal of connectivity analysis is to exploit linkage information
between documents, based on the assumption
that a link between two documents implies that the documents
contain related content (Assumption i), and that
if the documents were authored by dierent people then
the rst author found the second document valuable (Assumption
ii). In 1997 Kleinberg [21] published an algorithm
for connectivity analysis on the World Wide Web
which we describe next.
