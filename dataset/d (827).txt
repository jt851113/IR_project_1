Temporal data reduction is cheap since it involves only computation
at a single sensor, and incurs no communication overhead. The
first step towards constructing a multi-resolution hierarchy, therefore,
consists of each node reducing the time-series data as much as
possible by exploiting temporal redundancy in the signal and apriori
knowledge about signal characteristics. By reducing the temporal
datastream to include only potentially interesting events, the
communication overhead of spatial decomposition is reduced.
Consider the example of a multi-resolution hierarchy for building
health monitoring (Table 1). Such a hierarchy is constructed
to enable querying and data extraction of time-series signals corresponding
to interesting vibration events. The local signal processing
involves two steps: (a) Each node performs simple realtime
filtering to extract time-series that may represent interesting
events. The filtering could be a simple amplitude thresholding i.e.
events that cross a pre-determined SNR threshold. The thresholding
yields short time-series sequences of building vibrations. (b)
These time-series snippets are compressed using wavelet subband
coding to yield a sequence that capture as much energy of the signal
as possible, given communication, computation or error constraints
