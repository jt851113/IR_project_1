Information on the Web is often duplicated and
expressed in a variety of forms. If all information
was (correctly) expressed in all possible ways, precise
information retrieval would be simple: A search
for any one particular way of expressing the information
would succeed.
The NECI engine recognizes and transforms
certain queries submitted in the form of a question
into queries phrased in the form of an answer—
specific expressive forms (SEFs). For example, the
query “What does NASDAQ stand for?” is transformed
into the query “NASDAQ stands for”
“NASDAQ is an abbreviation” “NASDAQ
means.” Clearly the information may be expressed
in forms other than these, but if the information
exists in just one of these forms, it is more likely to
satisfy the query. The technique thus trades recall
for precision.
Our informal experiments indicate that using
SEFs is effective for certain retrieval tasks on the
Web. Figure 4 shows the NECI engine’s results for
the query “What does NASDAQ stand for?” The
answer to the query is contained in the local context
displayed for four out of the first five pages. In
contrast, the standard search engines we queried
did not have the answer in any of the documents
listed on the first page—even for engines that list
support for natural language queries.
As the amount of easily accessible information
increases, so too will the viability of the SEF technique.
An extension to it that we have not yet
implemented is to define an order over the various
SEFs. For example, “x stands for” might be more
likely to find the answer than “x means.” If none
of the SEFs are found, the engine could fall back
to a standard query.
Currently, the NECI metasearch engine uses the
SEF technique for a number of queries. For example,
the engine recognizes “What [is|are] x ?,”
“What [causes|creates|produces] x?,” “What does
x [stand for|mean]?,” and “[Why|how] [is|are]
(a|the) x y ?” As examples of the transformations,
“What does x [stand for|mean]?” is converted to “x
stands for,” “x is an abbreviation,” and “x means”;
and “What [causes|creates|produces] x?” is converted
to “x is caused,” “x is created,” “causes x,”
“produces x,” “makes x,” and “creates x.” Although
we created the SEF transformations manually, an
interesting area of research would be to learn SEFs
from implicit or explicit feedback.
