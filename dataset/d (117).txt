Figure 6 (on p. 45) shows a sample document from
the “digital watermark” search. The links at the top
jump to the first occurrence of the query terms in
the document, and indicate the number of occurrences.
Each query term within the text also links
to the next use of the term. Such linking and highlighting
helps users quickly identify page relevance.
The NECI engine can also track query results and
page contents, automatically informing users when
new matching documents are found or when a
given page has been modified (“Track page”).
Currently, the NECI engine uses two forms of
caching. The engine caches all downloaded pages
for a limited time period, and query terms and links
are added on demand. The engine also caches the
top 20 relevance-ranked results from each query. If
a user repeats the query, these pages are the first displayed—
if they still exist and contain the query
terms.
