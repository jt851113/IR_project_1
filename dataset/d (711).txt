In many networked environments, caches are shared
among multiple users and cache contents must be managed
in a way that maximizes the benefit for the user community
as a whole. The applications described above have shared
cache analogs. In data recharging, we assume that users can

stations would maintain a shared cache that would service
users who are likely to connect there in the future. For thin
pipes, a shared cache is placed between the connection and
a user community. This cache is used to mitigate the latency
effects of the thin pipe.
