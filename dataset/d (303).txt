Modern society calls for collaboration on almost every nontrivial task. While collaboration brings di?erent individuals, organizations, and resources together, it also triggers the dilemma of making decisions in many aspects[1]. For example, when selecting one of the distributed servers to response a given request from an online user, the decision shall be made based on multiple indicators of available servers, such as the service quality, the available capacity, the waiting queue length, the failure ratio, the transfer speed, and the cost, etc. Another example is the concurrency control system must make trade-o?s between interactive response time, latency in propagating updates, consistency of display with shared data, etc. Skyline queries have been widely used in multi-criteria decision making applications, where a number of (usually) contradictory criteria participate towards selecting the most convenient answers to the user[2]. However, conventional skyline has two problems: (1) retrieves enormous objects in high dimensionalities, diminishing its power to distinguish optimal choices; (2) users may not be interested in the whole set of
dimensions. K-dominant skyline tackles this problem by relaxing the dominance de?nition[3]. In aforementioned server example, instead of taking all parameters into consideration, the agent could consider a server better than the other if 4 indicators out of 6. K-dominant skyline query can promise a moderate size of answers by choosing an appropriate k. It could serve as a good substitute for conventional skyline query in high dimensional space. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses related work. Section III presents the notions and properties of k-dominant skyline computation. Section IV gives the details and analysis of our algorithms. Section V presents some representative experimental results and Section VI concludes our study ?nally.
