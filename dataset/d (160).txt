The key idea behind the extension of One-Scan approach
(shown as Algorithm 4) is to keep track, for each point
, the maximum value of k for which p has been kdominated.
We use maxkdom(p) to denote this value for
p. A point is maintained in R so long as maxkdom(p) <
|S| (i.e., p is at least a free skyline point). At the end of
processing all the points in D, for each point, p is a kdominant
skyline point  [maxkdom(p) + 1, |S|]. Thus,
the top-δ dominant skyline points are the δ points in R with
the smallest value of maxkdom(.).
