Given the broad, flat structure of wireless
sensor networks, collecting information from
the entire network at a single sink can result in
immense network traffic near the sink. This
characteristic is at odds with the fact that most
current structural health monitoring algorithms
are centralized, and even given a
distributed algorithm, eventually data needs to
be supplied to a human operator. Data aggre
gation is an approach to help alleviate this
pressure; as information flows towards the
sink, similar data from different sources is
aggregated into a single message, rather than
forwarded as separate messages.
Data aggregation has primarily been
studied in relation to power savings (Intanagonwiwat
et al. 2001, Krishnamachari et al.
2002) or computing simple functions over the
entire network's data set (Madden et al. 2002).
We have found that aggregation can also be
used to improve the quality of data available
to a real-time application. In our approach to
data aggregation, the network is structured as
a hierarchy, with the centralized client to the
aggregation service at the highest level. In
addition to sampling its own data, each sensor
node maintains a predictive model of some
function of the readings from sensors at lower
levels. Rather than continually transmitting
the newest samples, messages are only sent to
update the predictive models at higher levels.
These messages are assigned priorities based
on the significance of the deviation between
the model and reality (Figure 3). Such a
priority based communication scheme is
explored in Karl et al. (2003).
