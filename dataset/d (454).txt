Definition 2.9 Given a pattern P, a sequence D and a gen-
eralized information gain threshold g, if there exists a subse-
quence of so that the generalized information gain of
with respect to is at least, then is a valid pattern.

Theoretically, the period of a valid pattern could be arbitrary,
i.e., as long as the event sequence. In reality, a user can specify
an upperbound of period length according to his/her domain
knowledge. As a result, we use to denote the maximum
period allowed for a pattern. However,can be arbitrarily
large, e.g., ranging to several thousands. Now we can rephrase
our problem model by employing the generalized information
gain metric. For a sequence of events, an information gain
threshold, and a period bound, we want to discovery
all valid patterns whose period is less than. In addi-
tion,for each valid pattern, we want to find the subsequence
which maximizes the generalized information gain of. In
the remainder of this section, we give some more definitions
which enable us to present our approach and communicate to
readers more effectively.

Since we aim at mining periodic patterns, only repeated occurrences of a
pattern are used to accumulate the generalized information gain.
