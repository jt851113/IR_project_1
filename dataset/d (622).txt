The algorithm works in a bottom-up fashion. The algorithm
first elects the level-1 clusterheads, then level-2 clusterheads,
and so on. The level-1 clusterheads are chosen as follows. Each
sensor decides to become a level-1 CH with certain probability
p1 and advertises itself as a clusterhead to the sensors within
its radio range. This advertisement is forwarded to all the
sensors within k1 hops of the advertising CH. Each sensor that
receives an advertisement joins the cluster of the closest level-1
CH; the remaining sensors become forced level-1 CHs.
Level-1 CHs then elect themselves as level-2 CHs with a
certain probability p2 and broadcast their decision of
becoming a level-2 CH. This decision is forwarded to all the
sensors within k2 hops. The level-1 CHs that receive the
advertisements from level-2 CHs joins the cluster of the closest
level-2 CH. All other level-1 CHs become forced level-2 CHs.
Clusterheads at level 3, 4,..., h are chosen in similar fashion,
with probabilities p3 , p4 ,..., ph respectively, to generate a
hierarchy of CHs, in which any level-i CH is also a CH of level
(i-1), (i-2),â€¦, 1.
