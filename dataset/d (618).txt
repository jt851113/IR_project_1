Each sensor in the network becomes a clusterhead (CH)
with probability p and advertises itself as a clusterhead to the
sensors within its radio range. We call these clusterheads the
volunteer clusterheads. This advertisement is forwarded to all
the sensors that are no more than k hops away from the
clusterhead. Any sensor that receives such advertisements and
is not itself a clusterhead joins the cluster of the closest
clusterhead. Any sensor that is neither a clusterhead nor has
joined any cluster itself becomes a clusterhead; we call these
clusterheads the forced clusterheads. Because we have limited
the advertisement forwarding to k hops, if a sensor does not
receive a CH advertisement within time duration t (where t
units is the time required for data to reach the clusterhead from
any sensor k hops away) it can infer that it is not within k
hops of any volunteer clusterhead and hence become a forced
clusterhead. Moreover, since all the sensors within a cluster are
at most k hops away from the cluster-head, the clusterhead can
transmit the aggregated information to the processing center
after every t units of time. This limit on the number of hops
thus allows the cluster-heads to schedule their transmissions.
Note that this is a distributed algorithm and does not demand
clock synchronization between the sensors.
The energy used in the network for the information
gathered by the sensors to reach the processing center will
depend on the parameters p and k of our algorithm. Since the
objective of our work is to organize the sensors in clusters to
minimize this energy consumption, we need to find the values
of the parameters p and k of our algorithm that would ensure
minimization of energy consumption. We derive expressions
for optimal values of p and k in the next subsection.
