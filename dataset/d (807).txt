DFuse uses a distributed role assignment algorithm for placing
fusion points in the network. Role assignment is a mapping
from a fusion point in an application task graph to a network
node. The distributed role assignment algorithm is triggered at
the root node. The inputs to the algorithm are an application
task graph (assuming the source nodes are known), a cost function,
and attributes specific to the cost function. The output is
an overlay network that optimizes the role to be performed by
each node of the network. The “goodness” of the role assignment
is with respect to the input cost function.
A network node can play one of three roles: end point (source
or sink), relay, or fusion point [3]. An end point corresponds to
a data source or a sink. The network nodes that correspond to
end points and fusion points may not always be directly reachable
from one another. In this case, data forwarding relay nodes
may be used to route messages among them. The routing layer
(Figure 2) is responsible for assigning a relay role to any network
node. The role assignment algorithm assigns only the
fusion point roles.
