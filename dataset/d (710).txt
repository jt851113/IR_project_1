Data Recharging: Data recharging [9] is best understood
in the context of mobile computing environments. Mobile
computers have two fundamental renewable resources:
power and data. The goal of data recharging is to make
recharging data from the data grid as simple and robust as
recharging power from the power grid. Based on a user profile,
data recharging middleware gathers data of interest to
a user, and when the user next connects to the network, this
data is delivered to the user’s mobile device. In this case,
the profile would reflect some aspect of the user’s context
(e.g., location, workflow) and data delivered would depend
on available resources on the mobile device (e.g., memory,
applications). The order in which items are delivered also
matters if unplanned disconnection is possible.
In the mobile environment, computers are often
memory-limited. Thus, given a large amount of potentially
interesting data, a data recharging system must make decisions
about what subsets of this data are to be allocated to
the limited memory resource.
Thin-Pipe Environments: In this situation, the client is
connected to the network through a thin pipe. A thin pipe
can be a result of a bandwidth constrained connection or a
heavily overloaded server. The essential characteristic here
is that using the pipe introduces very high latency. Inserting
a cache at the client end attempts to hide this latency. An
item whose access is extremely likely is prefetched in order
to eliminate the latency of its first access. Prefetching is
inherently predictive, and profiles support our prediction.
