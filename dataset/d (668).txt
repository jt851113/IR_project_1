We have presented new methods for approximately
computing duplicate-sensitive aggregates across dis-
tributed datasets. Our immediate motivation comes
from sensor networks, where energy consumption is a
primary concern, faults occur frequently, and exact an-
swers are not required or expected. An elegant building
block which enables our techniques are the duplicate-
insensitive sketches of Flajolet and Martin, which give
us considerable freedom in our choices of how best to
route data and where to compute partial aggregates. In
particular, use of this duplicate-insensitive data struc-
ture allowed us to make use of dispersity routing meth-
ods to provide fault tolerance that would be inappro-
priate otherwise.
The implications of these results reach beyond sen-
sor networks to other unreliable systems with dis-
tributed datasets over which best-eort aggregate
queries are posed. Examples include estimating the
number of subscribers participating in a multicast ses-
sion, or counting the number of peers storing a copy
of a given le in a peer-to-peer network. In these set-
tings, nodes are less resource-constrained than in sen-
sor networks, but the problems are still diAcult due
to packet loss and frequent node arrivals and depar-
tures.
