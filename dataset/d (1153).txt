NiagaraCQ is being developed as a sub-system of Niagara
project. The initial version of the system was implemented in
Java (JDK1.2). A validating XML parser (IBM XML4J) from
IBM is used to parse XML documents. We describe the system
architecture of NiagaraCQ in Section 4.1 and how continuous
queries are processed in Section 4.2.
