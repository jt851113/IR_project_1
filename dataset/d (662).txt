Since our protocols are being developed for use in
sensor networks, it is important to ensure that they do
not exceed the capabilities of individual sensors. Sec-
tion 4.3.1 considers the computational costs of gen-
erating random numbers for the summation sketches
of 3.2. Section 4.3.2 considers the bandwidth overhead
of sending sketches.
