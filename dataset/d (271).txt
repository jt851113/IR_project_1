Wireless sensor networks are an important type of resource-constrained distributed event-based system. We have modelled and analyzed the performance of data aggregation in such networks. We identi?ed and investigated some of the factors affecting performance, such as the number of placement of sources, and the communication net
work topology. The formation of an optimal data aggregation tree is generally NP-hard. We presented some suboptimal data aggregation tree generation heuristics and showed the existence of polynomial special cases. The modelling tells us that whether the sources are clustered near each other or located randomly, signi?cant energy gains are possible with data aggregation. These gains are greatest when the number of sources is large, and when the sources are located relatively close to each other and far from the sink. The modelling, though, also seems to suggest that aggregation latency could be non-negligible and should be taken into consideration during the design process. Data-centric architectures such as directed diffusion should support a Type of Service (TOS) facility that would permit applications to effect desired tradeoffs between latency and energy. In-system processing of data is useful to avoid overwhelming the consumer of data noti?cation, be it a person or a program. Thus the results we have presented in this paper for a resource-constrained event-based system might well hold important design lessons for scalable event-based systems, even if they are less constrained.
