The purpose of our experiments is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate
the gains obtained by using our algorithms, and (2)
to provide insight on how the benefit varies with different
parameters such as number of nodes and the number of
auxiliary neighbors. We first describe our experimental setup
and then present the results of our experiments.
