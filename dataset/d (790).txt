the number of cycles in a pattern (The number of cycles a
pattern of length contains is equal to len on the average).
In order to model the fact that real world data will consist
of a mixture of cyclic rules and non-cyclic rules, we use
the “noise” parameter, which is a real number between 0
and 1. In a particular time unit, a large itemset is “active”
(in the sense that transactions will contain that itemset)
independent of cycles with a probability
.At the beginning of each time unit, the data generation
algorithm first determines which large itemsets should be
used for data generation in that time unit. This is done by
checking to see if the current time ?? participates in any of the
cycles that the itemset is associated with. Following this,
a determination is made as to whether the noise parameter
dictates that the itemset be used. Once this is done, the
weights associated with the large itemsets determine their
occurrences in the transactions for the time unit.
The default values we used for the parameters in our
experiments are shown in Table 3. (We conducted individual
sets of experiments that varied these parameters. We
describe the variations when we describe the individual
experiments.)
When the parameters are set to the above default values,
the size of the data generated is about 155 megabytes (MB)
for all the time units combined.
