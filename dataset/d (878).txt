In this section, we introduce our intelligence-based approach
for information retrieval in mobile P2P networks,
which mimics social human behaviors to facilitate efficient
information retrieval. It re-adjusts IA values after query
processes just like people learning from their experiences; it
updates and exchanges the intelligence information as the
way people gossip; its strategies to forward queries like people
finding answers from acquaintances.
As shown in Figure 1, a query routing process can be
divided into several forwarding steps. At each step, the participant
forwards the query to one of its neighbors within
its reachable range, by checking the intelligence information
provided by them. Here, we define a node’s reachable range
as the range in which the node can reach all other nodes
in one-hop connection. We use query time-to-live (TTL) to
control the hops of query propagation. If the query routing
path’s length is equal to TTL and the result is still not
found, the query fails in finding its results. Otherwise, the
resource provider node (denoted as R-provider) will send
the result back along the query routing path to the query
issuer node (denoted as Q-issuer). As discussed in [25, 16],
an appropriate value of TTL is needed to tradeoff the success
probability of queries and the overall query load in the
network. However, this value is highly dependent on the
workload and the network scenario.
