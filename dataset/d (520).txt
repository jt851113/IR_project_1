5.2 Experiment Setup
The following parameters (some of them are adopted from
[6]) are used to generate a set of query patterns and a set of
access graphs.
PARAMETERS:
. Number of data objects: The number of data objects
being broadcast, which is also the number of vertices
in the access graph.
. Data object size: The size of each data object being
broadcast.
. Out-degree: The out-degree for each vertex in the
access graph.
. Edge weight: The weight associated with each edge in
the access graph.
The parameter settings for evaluating the complete
approach and the scheduling algorithm only are listed in
Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The notation ; b;T
denotes a range of numbers from a to b in the Zipfâ€™s
distribution [10] with factor . Notice that the values
generated by Zipf(a, b, 0) are uniformly distributed in
[a, b]. Moreover, as  increases, the probability of generating
a large value increases. The value generated by Zipf(a, b, 1)
is b. We assume the out-degree of each vertex is among the
values of {0, 1, 2, 3}. Also, we use the ratio of the out-degrees
to vary the connectivity of the access graph. For example,
when the ratio is 6:1:1:1, the probability of the vertex with
zero out-degree is six times of that of the vertex with other
out-degrees.
