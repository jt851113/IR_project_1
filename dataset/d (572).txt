In this section, we present the energy cost of expanding ring search and flooding based query
mechanisms. While the expanding ring search is not currently implemented in any sensor
querying protocols we are aware of, it is a better baseline for comparison than the clearly
inefficient flooding-based querying, as far as one-shot queries are concerned.
