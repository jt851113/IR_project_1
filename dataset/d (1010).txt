Abstract—Skyline queries have recently attracted a lot of
attention for its intuitive query formulation. It can act
as a filter to discard sub-optimal objects. However, a
major drawback of skyline is that, in datasets with many
dimensions, the number of skyline objects becomes large
and no longer offer any interesting insights. To solve the
problem, recently k-dominant skyline queries have been
introduced, which can reduce the number of skyline objects
by relaxing the definition of the dominance. This paper
addresses the problem of k-dominant skyline objects for
high dimensional dataset. We propose algorithms for k-
dominant skyline computation. Our algorithms reduce the
pairwise comparison between the k-dominant skyline objects
and the dataset. Through extensive experiments with real
and synthetic datasets, we confirm that our algorithms can
efficiently compute k-dominant skyline queries.
