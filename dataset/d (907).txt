The choice of the number of steps and the draining threshold
for each step in the DAB tree construction may affect the quality
of the constructed tree. On one extreme, if the entire tree is
constructed in a single step, there is no distinction being made
between high and low rate regions, and so the resulting tree
does not take advantage of rate information. Such a tree is
more likely to be balanced, and thus have low height, since
there are no “gaps” in the sensors to force it to a less balanced
shape. However, the communication cost for such a tree will
likely be high.
On the other extreme, if the tree is constructed using an
excessive number of steps, there tends to be a very limited
choice of sensors to merge during each step, and consequently
very little opportunity to enhance tree balance. In this case, the
resulting tree’s shape is dictated by the positions of sensors
uncovered in each step, possibly leading to a tree with long
links and a large height. To achieve a reasonably balanced tree,
the number of steps for the tree construction will generally
need to be small.
The setting of the numbers of DAB steps and their draining
thresholds should generally depend on the movement frequency
as a function of locations in the region where objects
are tracked. For example, the DAB method with uniformly
spaced draining thresholds is expected to work well for traffic
patterns where similar variations in movement frequency
appear throughout the region, such as the traffic pattern
depicted in Figure 7d.
Note that the DAB method may not help for certain traffic
patterns such as those exhibiting little locality. For example,
very regular traffic patterns, such as a constant or a strictly
increasing movement frequency over a 1D region do not offer
opportunities for DAB to improve performance over straightforward
traffic-oblivious methods.
