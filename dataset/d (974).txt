[ 1 ] Experiments on SYNTHETIC5D
The data stream Synthetic5D was constructed with 15,000 events
composed of 5 attributes. The events were generated with different correlations
among their attributes, defining 5 consecutive sequences of 3,000 events, as
follows:
 1st sequence: 5 attributes correlated to each other - events distributed as
a line ) D = 1;
 2nd sequence: 2 attributes correlated to the other 3 - events distributed
as a cube ) D = 3;
 3rd sequence: 5 attributes completely independent - events randomly
distributed ) D = 5;
 4th sequence: 3 attributes correlated to the other 2 - events distributed
as a plane ) D = 2;
 5th sequence: 1 attribute correlated to 1 of the others - events distributed
as a 4-dimensional hyper-cube ) D = 4.
We measured the behavior of D by using a sliding window divided into 10
counting periods (nc = 10) with 300 events each (ni = 300), such that the value
of D is computed over the past 3,000 events and updated every 300 events.
Figure 13 shows the values of D at the end of successive counting periods.
According to the behavior of the stream, D is very close to 1.0 at the end of
period 10, when the sliding window is full and D is calculated using 3,000 events
of the 1st sequence. At each periods from 11 to 20, the 300 oldest events are
discarded whenever a period begins and the correlations among the attributes
change, increasing the value of D to 3.0 accordingly. From periods 21 to 30 the
events of the 3rd sequence are processed, increasing D until it closely approaches
5.0. The events of the 4th sequence diminish D, which reaches 2.0 in period 40.
Finally, from the 40th period on, the value of D evolves to reach 4.0, following
the behavior of the changing data.
[ 2 ] Experiments on LIS2D
The Lis2D dataset is composed of events whose values characterize two
Lissajou curves: the first one is defined by 10,000 points < x = sin(7t); y =
cos(5t) >, t 2 [0; 2?]; the second curve is defined by raising the frequencies of
the signals, resulting in 10,000 points < x = sin(23t); y = cos(21t) >, t 2 [0; 2?].
On this experiment we used 10 counting periods (nc = 10) with 500 events each
(ni = 500). Figure 14 shows how the intrinsic dimension of the data stream
evolves. It can be noted by the construction of the data stream that the signal
sare more asynchronous on the second Lissajou curve. Therefore, the events from
the 20th period forth significantly increase D from 1:25 to 1:71.
