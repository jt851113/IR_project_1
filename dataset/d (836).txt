We now look at the performance of our system on a packet throughput
dataset from a 12x14 grid of nodes with grid spacing 2 feet
(detailed descriptions can be obtained from [15]). Each node has
throughput data from all other transmitters, for twenty different settings
of transmit signal strength from each node. Two forms of correlations
can be exploited to reduce size of data: (a) correlation in
throughput between adjacent transmitters to a particular receiver,
and (b) correlation in throughput from a single transmitter to adjacent
receivers.
Figure 5 shows the results of a query to obtain the throughput vs
distance map from the compressed data. The error is small in the
approximated data, and gives us large compression benefit. These
results show that our algorithm works for a broad class of data with
different correlation characteristics.
