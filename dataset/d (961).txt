The experiments in the previous section demonstrated
the ability of Fjords to efficiently handle many queries over
streaming data. We now turn our attention to another key aspect
of sensor query processing, the impact of sample rate
on both sensor lifetime and the ability of Fjords to process
sensor data. We focus on sensors that are similar to the
wireless sensors motes described in Section 2.1 above.
