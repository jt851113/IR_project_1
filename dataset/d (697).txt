In this section, we present a preliminary performance study demonstrating
the features of our system, and the flexibility and effectiveness
of our architecture. The salient points of our experimental
study can be summarized as follows :
 Our flexible architecture allowing arbitrary logical-to-physical
mappings can harvest the processing power in the system
more effectively than any traditional solution.
 Caching can be very effective in both reducing latencies of
queries, and in offloading work to increase overall throughput.
 Compiling XSLT queries directly leads to huge savings in
query processing time.
