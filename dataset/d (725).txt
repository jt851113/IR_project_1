Online social networks (OSNs) with half a billion users have
dramatically raised concerns on privacy leakage. Users, often
willingly, share personal identifying information about
themselves, but do not have a clear idea of who accesses their
private information or what portion of it really needs to be
accessed. In this study we examine popular OSNs from a
viewpoint of characterizing potential privacy leakage. Our
study identies what bits of information are currently being
shared, how widely, and what users can do to prevent such
sharing. We also examine the role of third-party sites that
track OSN users and compare with privacy leakage on popular
traditional Web sites. Our long term goal is to identify
the narrow set of private information that users really need
to share to accomplish specic interactions on OSNs.
