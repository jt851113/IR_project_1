In the emerging area of sensor-based systems, a sig-
nicant challenge is to develop scalable, fault-tolerant
methods to extract useful information from the data the
sensors collect. An approach to this data management
problem is the use of sensor database systems, exempli-
ed by TinyDB and Cougar, which allow users to per-
form aggregation queries such as MIN, COUNT and
AVG on a sensor network. Due to power and range con-
straints, centralized approaches are generally impracti-
cal, so most systems use in-network aggregation to re-
duce network traAc. However, these aggregation strate-
gies become bandwidth-intensive when combined with the
fault-tolerant, multi-path routing methods often used in
these environments. For example, duplicate-sensitive ag-
gregates such as SUM cannot be computed exactly us-
ing substantially less bandwidth than explicit enumera-
tion. To avoid this expense, we investigate the use of ap-
proximate in-network aggregation using small sketches.
Our contributions are as follows: 1) we generalize well
known duplicate-insensitive sketches for approximating
COUNTto handle SUM,2)we present and analyze meth-
ods for using sketches to produce accurate results with
low communication and computation overhead, and 3)
we present an extensive experimental validation of our
methods.
