When a user browses the result list for a query, the title,
document reference and snippet help him to determine
relevant document w.r.t his query and interests. Accessed
documents and user interest profiles are thus the important
feedback information that is exploited by the CFRS. When
the user selects one element in the results list for a query Q,
the following information is tracked: (1) the query Q is used
to route the feedback information to P(Q), the peer responsible
for processing it; (2) the document reference D â€” this
is the identifier of the document (its nature depends on the
centralized search mechanism being used, e.g., an URL for
Web searching, a file hash for P2P file sharing, etc.) and the
document descriptors (title, snippet); (3) the document profile
DP which is extracted from the content or description
of D, in a form of a Bloom filter. Meanwhile, the profile of
accessed documents is inserted into the local interest profiles
as described in the previous section.
