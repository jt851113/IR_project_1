DEFINITION 2.7. Given a pattern 	, a sequence  and a
generalized information gain threshold , if there exists a
subsequence  of  so that the generalized information gain
of  with respect to 	 is at least , then 	 is a valid pattern.
Theoretically, the period of a valid pattern could be arbitrary,
i.e., as long as the event sequence. In reality, a user can
specify an upperbound of period length according to his/her
domain knowledge. As a result, we use 
 to denote
the maximum period allowed for a pattern. However, 

can be arbitrarily large, e.g., ranging to several thousands.
Now we can rephrase our problem model by employing the
generalized information gain metric. For a sequence of events
, a generalized information gain threshold , and a period
bound 
, we want to discovery all valid patterns 	 whose
period is less than 
.
For each valid pattern 	, we want to find the subsequence
which maximizes the generalized information gain of 	. In the
remainder of this section, we give some more definitions which
enable us to present our approach STAMP and communicate to
readers more effectively.
