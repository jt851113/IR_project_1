The test data was generated by an IBM synthetic-data generator. The
simulations were implemented in JAVA and all the experiments were performed
by an Intel Pentium 3.0 GHz computer. Table 1 shows the parameter
settings for comparing efficiencies of DFPFM and PFM. Here
the maximum bitmap size that can be stored in memory is assumed to be
