Our data generator is based on the synthetic data generator
used in [AS94]. We augmented it to generate data for
cyclic association rules. In addition to the parameters used
by [AS94] shown in Table 1, we used additional parameters
shown in Table 2 (The parameters are described in the
following paragraphs).
The generation of the large itemsets and their weights
closely follows the procedure in [AS94]. We generate
itemsets of average size
. Each itemset is associated with
a weight, which is an exponentially distributed random
variable. We define a pattern to be the union of a set
of cycles of the same length. For example, pattern 1001
represents the union of cycles 4 and 4. In order
to model the fact that certain rules might occur cyclically,
we associate num patterns with each large itemset that we
generate. The length of the patterns is uniformly distributed
between min and max time units. The density parameter
den, which is a real number between 0 and 1, controls
