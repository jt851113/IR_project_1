To improve the variance and condence of the es-
timator, FM sketches can use multiple bitmaps. That
is, each item is inserted into each of m independent
bitmaps to produce m R values, Rh1i; : : : ;Rhmi. The
estimate is then calculated as follows:
This estimate is more accurate, with standard error
O(1=pm), but comes at the cost of increased insertion
times (O(m)). To avoid this overhead, an algorithm
called Probabilistic Counting with Stochastic Averaging,
or PCSA, was proposed in [7]. Instead of inserting each
item into each of the m bitmaps, each item is hashed
and inserted into only one of them. Thus, each of the
bitmaps summarizes approximately n=m items. While
there is some variation in how many items are assigned
to each bitmap, further analysis showed that the stan-
dard error of PCSA is roughly 0:78=pm. Using PCSA,
insertion takes O(1) expected time.
PCSA can also be applied to summation sketches,
but greater care must be applied when combining
PCSA to summation sketches. The potential for imbal-
ance is much larger with summation sketches - a sin-
gle item can contribute an arbitrarily large fraction of
the total sum. Thus, we employ the following strategy.
Each ci value has the form ci = qim+ri for some inte-
gers qi and ri, with 0  ri < m.We then add ri distinct
items once as in standard PCSA, and then add qi to
each bitmap independently. Thus, we preserve the bal-
ance necessary for the improved accuracy and its anal-
ysis, but at the cost of O(mlog2(ci=m)) for each inser-
tion. We will employ PCSA in our experiments.
