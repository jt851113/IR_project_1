In this section, a method of finding recent frequent itemsets
adaptively over an online data stream is proposed based on the
decay mechanism described in Section 2. The different
combinations of items that appear in each transaction are
maintained in a prefix-tree lattice structure [7,8] called as a
monitoring lattice. A node in a monitoring lattice contains an item
and it denotes an itemset composed of items that are in the nodes
of its path from the root.
