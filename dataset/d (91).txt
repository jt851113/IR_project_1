The first of the two problems introduced above – namely
the question of how strongly we can compress peer profiles
and still have acceptable recall – has received relatively little
attention in both the DIR and the P2PIR community.
In P2PIR, this may be because many approaches do not use
unigram language models for representing peers. One exception
is [3] where various pruning algorithms are presented.
However, the work in [3] does not consider absolute thresholds
for profile sizes as we do here, but varies parameters
of pruning algorithms, leading to varying, but unpredictible
profile sizes.
In DIR, on the other hand, resource descriptions are usually
stored on large broker servers where space constraints
are not a major problem. However, some work has been
done on that topic [18], pruning index terms from long documents.
However, the trade-off between profile size and retrieval
effectiveness is not evaluated systematically.
