The sensors which become the clusterhead in the proposed
architecture spend relatively more energy than other sensors
because they have to receive information from all the sensors
within their cluster, aggregate this information and then
communicate to the higher level clusterheads or the
information processing center.
Hence, they may run out of their energy faster than other
sensors. As proposed in [6], the clustering algorithm can be run
periodically for load balancing. Instead of running the
algorithm periodically, another possibility is that clusterheads
trigger the clustering algorithm when their energy levels fall
below a certain threshold. Among many other issues, the
behavior of the proposed clustering algorithm and the hierarchy
generated by it in event of sensor failures is worth
investigating.
