Figure 8 shows the average query success rate for different
methods. Clearly, the flooding approach performs best, as it
always floods the query to all the neighbors, thus it will not
miss any results stored in these neighbors. Compared with
IA and Eureka, we find that IA is a little worse than Eureka
in 100-node network, while it outperforms Eureka when the
network size becomes larger. Although the proposed IA approach
selects one path to forward the query, the IA value
can effectively capture the information of data resources in
the network, and forward the query to the most promising
neighbor. In such a highly dynamic environment, data and
peers are frequently updated. The higher query success rate
indicates higher scalability of our approach over Eureka.
