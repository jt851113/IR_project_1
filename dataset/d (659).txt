We now analyze the methods discussed so far for a
restricted class of regular topologies. We compare the
resilience of a single spanning tree against using mul-
tiple parents, but only one broadcast per node, as de-
scribed in the previous section. For simplicity, we only
consider exact COUNT aggregate under independent
link failures; more elaborate analysis for other aggre-
gates and failure models is possible. These calculations
tend to be \back of the envelope" in nature; they illus-
trate the advantages of multipath routing over span-
ning trees for resilience. For more detailed analysis, we
refer the reader to work such as [22].
In the following, we use p as the probability of (in-
dependent) link loss, and h as the maximum number
of hops from the sink.
