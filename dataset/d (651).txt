One of the core ideas behind our work is that dupli-
cate insensitive sketches will allow us to leverage the
robustness typically associated with multi-path rout-
ing. We now present some of the theory behind such
sketches and extend it to handle more interesting ag-
gregates. First, we present details of the FM sketches
of [7] along with necessary parts of the theory behind
them. Then, we generalize these sketches to handle
summations, and show that they have almost exactly
the same accuracy as FM sketches.
