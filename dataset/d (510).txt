In this section, how to represent a set of query patterns as an
access graph is discussed. A query pattern contains an
ordered access triple [SA, JA, PA]. Notice that there is no
access order constraint among the data objects in SA, JA, or
PA. As mentioned above, an access graph is a directed
weighted graph, where each node represents a data object
and each edge eij represents the access order from data
object i to data object j. The weight associated with eij
denotes the total frequencies of the accesses from data
object i to data object j. Therefore, to transform a set of query
patterns to an access graph, the access order of the data
objects in SA, JA, and PA should be determined.
There are two steps to determine the access order. The
first step makes use of the known access order of some data
object pairs and the second step makes use of Property 2
given in Section 2.
