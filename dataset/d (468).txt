DEFINITION 2.3. The information of a pattern 	 
       is the summation of the information carried by
each individual position, i.e., 	    .
Figure 1 shows the set of events corresponding to different
workload states of a web server. There are total 1024 different
events. Their probabilities of occurrence are arbitrarily assigned
and the corresponding information is calculated accordingly.
We use 10246 as the base in the calculation. The information
of pattern      is        
  	

    	  	    . After defining
the information of a pattern, now we begin to formulate the
definition of information gain of a pattern in a subsequence of
events.
Given a pattern 	         with period  and a
sequence of  events         , we say that  is in
compliance with 	 at position       iff either   
or    holds. For example, the sequence     is in
compliance with the pattern     at positions 1 and 4.
Given a pattern 	         with period  and
a sequence of  events         , we say that 	
matches  (or  supports 	), iff  is in compliance
with 	 at every position     . For instance, the
sequence      supports the pattern     
while the sequence      does not support it since
the sequence is not in compliance with the pattern on the last
position.
