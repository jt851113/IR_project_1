Although data aggregation results in fewer transmissions, there is a tradeoff â€“ potentially greater delay in the case of some aggregation functions because data from nearer sources may have to be held back at an intermediate node in order to be aggregated with data coming from sources that are farther away. In the worst case, the latency due to aggregation will be proportional to the number of hops between the sink and the farthest source. One way to quantify the effect of aggregation delay is to examine the difference max(di)and min(di). This is shown in ?gures 5 and 6. Similar ?gures obtain for the random sources model as well. The experimental setup is the same as discussed in section 4.2. The upper curve in all these ?gures is representative of the latency delay in DC schemes with non-trivial aggregation functions and the lower curve is representative of the latency delay in AC schemes. The difference between these curves is greatest in both models when the communication radius is low, and the number of sources is high.
