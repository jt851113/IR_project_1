The communication cost when using histograms can be
quite high compared to methods like cdf-ctf [1], where the
statistics per term contains only two numbers.
Our two-phase peer-selection algorithm combines the effectiveness
of histograms with the low cost of methods like
cdf-ctf. It works as follows.
In the first phase, the initiating peer pq uses a method
(such as cdf-ctf) that has a low communication cost in order
to select the top- ?K most promising peers, where ?K is
larger than K but still much smaller than the number of
peers in the network. In the second phase, pq contacts the
peers responsible for the query terms and requests only the
histograms of the ?K peers that were selected in the first
phase. Next, pq uses the histograms to select the top-K
most promising peers, and sends the query to them.
