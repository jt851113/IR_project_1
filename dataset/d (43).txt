A sensor network consists of a large number of sensor
nodes [27]. Individual sensor nodes (or short, nodes)
are connected to other nodes in their vicinity through
a wireless network, and they use a multihop routing
protocol to communicate with nodes that are spatially
distant. Sensor nodes also have limited computation
and storage capabilities: a node has a general-purpose
CPU to perform computation and a small amount of
storage space to save program code and data.
We will distinguish a special type of node called a
gateway node. Gateway nodes are connected to components
outside of the sensor network through longrange
communication (such as cables or satellite links),
and all communication with users of the sensor network
goes through the gateway node.4
Since sensors are usually not connected to a fixed
infrastructure, they use batteries as their main power
supply, and preservation of power is one of the main
design considerations of a sensor network [34]. This
makes reduction of message traffic between sensors
very important.
4Relaxations of this requirement, such as communication
with the network via UAVs or via an arbitrary node are left
for future work.
