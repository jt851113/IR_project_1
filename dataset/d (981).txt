Greedy aggregation is a novel diffusion approach to construct a greedy incremental tree for data aggregation. This
approach differs from the previous diffusion approach (i.e., the opportunistic aggregation on a lowest latency tree) in
path establishment and maintenance. To construct a greedy incremental tree, a shortest path is established for only
the first source to the sink whereas each of the other sources is incrementally connected at the closest point on the
existing tree.
