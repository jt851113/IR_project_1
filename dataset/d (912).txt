TUN (Scalable Tracking using Networked Sensors), a
method for tracking large numbers of moving objects that
gains efficiency through hierarchical organization.
Second, we described the DAB (drain-and-balance) method
for building STUN hierarchies that take advantage of information
about the mobility patterns of the objects being tracked.
We have demonstrated that this method gains an advantage
over traffic-oblivious schemes when the mobility patterns
exhibit locality. As we argued, locality is to be expected in
large-scale environments, and so we conclude that the DAB
method is useful in large-scale sensor tracking systems.
