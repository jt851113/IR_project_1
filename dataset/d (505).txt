In this paper, we showed how to combine threshold-based burst
detection with time series forceasting methods in order to improve
the accuracy of burst detection. The evaluation results presented
above clearly show that there is no ultimate method. Rather, choosing
the right method depends on the kind of input data and the
bursts we want to detect (and in which granularity). In most cases,
the mean and single smoothing techniques are appropriate. If the
data contains a trend, the double smoothing technique should be
used. If this trend is going to change, we have to switch to a
window-based technique or combine it with some method for change
detection. In any case the input data should be analyzed a priori and
one should try to characterize it (and its potential future behavior)
before choosing the method to apply. Open issues are the determination
of suitable parameters for the smoothing techniques and the
development of efficient methods for ignoring elements from bursts
when determining forecasts.
