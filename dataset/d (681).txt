Several choices exist in the process of designing a sensor
network protocol. The AT structure and A3 protocol
are specialized to address general monitoring tasks. Specific
knowledge on the physical phenomena being monitored
can enable further optimizations. For example, in
monitoring a highly dynamic phenomenon, we may want
to instantiate rth to be a high value. Otherwise the resetting
of error tolerance may happen too often for adjustment
of the error bounds to be advantageous. Another
design parameter to be determined is the window size for
computing update frequency. A possible approach would
be to choose a larger window size for nodes in higher
levels allowing these nodes to make adjustment decisions
more conservatively.
In our work, the estimation of workload does not consider
energy levels of the individual sensor nodes. Further
optimizations to the A3 protocol can be achieved by
integrating energy consumption models for sensor nodes
into the adaptation process.
The cluster architecture itself may be further exploited
to improve the performance of in-network processing.
For instance, transmission schedules may be established
that dictate exactly when individual cluster members can
communicate in order to avoid collisions. Similarly, if
packet routing functionality is limited to cluster-heads,
other cluster members may be scheduled to sleep when
they are not transmitting and receiving, further optimizing
energy consumption. Implementing the above techniques
requires closer integration with network andMAC
layer protocols; this is a topic for future research.
