Burst detection is an important component of data stream processing.
Apart from monitoring applications where the identification
of bursts is the primary task, burst detection is also a useful
task for data cleaning. Thus, the goal of our work is a tight integration
of burst detection operators into a stream processing engine.
In the following, we describe this approach as part of our DSMS
StreamDB.
