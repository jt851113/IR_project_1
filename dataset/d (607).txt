In this paper we present the AlvisP2P IR engine, which en-
ables e±cient retrieval with multi-keyword queries from a
global document collection available in a P2P network. In
such a network, each peer publishes its local index and in-
vests a part of its local computing resources (storage, CPU,
bandwidth) to maintain a fraction of a global P2P index.
This investment is rewarded by the network-wide accessibil-
ity of the local documents via the global search facility.
The AlvisP2P engine uses an optimized overlay network
and relies on novel indexing/retrieval mechanisms that en-
sure low bandwidth consumption, thus enabling unlimited
network growth.
Our demonstration shows how an easy-to-install AlvisP2P
client can be used to join an existing P2P network, index
local (text or even multimedia) documents with collection-
speci¯c indexing mechanisms, and control access rights to
them.
