Fjords [28], CACQ [30], and TAG [29], along with the sensor catalog and visualization systems I have built form
a solid research foundation for sensor query processing. However, to complete the research projects described
above, and empirically verify the ideas presented in these papers, a complete system must be built, deployed,
and studied.
Thus, my primary research agenda is to develop the TeleTiny query processing system for streaming sensor
data. There are two key components to TeleTiny: an on-sensor query engine for computing aggregates and selections
in a power-efficient manner; and a server-side query-processor specially designed to handle streaming data
and continuous queries. Furthermore, the interface between these two components is very important, serving
two key roles: first, it allows sensor data to be treated like other types of streaming data without squandering the
limited power available to the motes and, second, it interfaces the database’s catalog the internal schema’s of the
neighboring motes.
Along with this core system, there are several important research problems the TeleTiny system will help to
answer. The first is a characterization of the real-world query and data workloads that are placed on the system
with an understanding of the bottlenecks and demands of query processing in a sensor environment. The second
is set of techniques (and expressions of those techniques to the end-user) that can be used to control and limit
the utilization of the very scarce power, memory, and bandwidth available to sensors.
