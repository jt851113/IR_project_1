The SEF technique often relies on the engine’s
ability to search for a phrase containing what are
typically “stop” words. These words are almost universally
filtered out by traditional information
retrieval systems. Web search engines vary in their
use of stop words, and we have found it necessary
to filter out certain phrases on an engine-by-engine
basis to prevent the engines from returning many
pages that do not contain the phrases.
