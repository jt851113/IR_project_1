In database field, a conventional dataset differs from a data stream in two
main aspects: firstly, a conventional dataset has a current “state”; secondly, it
can be accessed at any time to attend applications’ demands. A data stream, on
the contrary, has no current state and usually allows only one access to the data.
Usually, questions regarding the behavior of the data stream are made over the
last period of time. Thus, as the events flow, it is useful to store parameters
that can be used to answer a query whenever it is posed.
We showed that one important property of a dataset (conventional or
data stream) is its intrinsic dimension D. This property has a large impact over
the way many queries are executed. Moreover, the value of D is usually lower
than the embedding dimension E, potentially leading to significant performance
improvement when processing a query. In particular, D can be explored in
stream management for tasks such as cost and selectivity estimation, query
optimization and forecasting. Without loss of generality, such tasks can use the
changing value of D rather than the number of attributes E to represent the
behavior of the data.
Our work proposes a method to continuously measure D in evolving data
streams. The SID-meter module performs such calculations with the following
interesting properties.
 It can track D even if the behavior of the data stream skews intensely
over time.
2 After a short warm-up period, D can be asked at any time.
 Its complexity is linear on the number of events inside a sliding window
and independent of the number of attributes of the data stream.
 Its precision depends on the main memory availability, i.e., it can
self-adjust to achieve better precision if more memory becomes available.
Our experiments also demonstrate that by measuring the intrinsic
dimension we can track the changing behavior of evolving data streams,
extracting additional knowledge about attribute correlations. This knowledge
can also be applied, for example, in data mining tasks performed over data
streams.
